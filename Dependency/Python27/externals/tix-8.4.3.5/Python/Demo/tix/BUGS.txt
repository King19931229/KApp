1)	There seems to be a problem with ComboBox that shows up
in the ExFileSelectBox demo. The popdown scrolled list widget
is being created, then destroyed. This does not happen in Tcl Tix.
This is probably a sympton in Tix from _tkinter; if you find the cause 
of this, please post a patch on http://tix.sourceforge.net.
