Installing PyTix
----------------

0) To use PyTix, you need Tcl/Tk (V8.[012]), Tix (V8.1) and Python (V2.0).
   PyTix has been written and tested on a Intel Pentium running RH Linux 5.2
   with the above mentioned packages.

   There is nothing OS-specific in PyTix itself so it should work on
   any machine with Tix and Python installed.

1) Build and install Tcl/Tk 8.0 8.1 or 8.2 and Tix 8.1.
   Ensure that Tix is properly installed by running tixwish and executing
   the demo programs. Under Unix use the --enable-shared configure option
   for all three. We recommend tcl tcl8.2.3 for this release of PyTix.

   Note that Tix 8.1 does not compile with Tcl 8.3 under Windows out of the
   box although it seems to compile and run OK. You might want to use
   Tcl 8.2 instead. 

2) Modify _tkinter.c in the Modules directory of the Python distribution.
   The modified _tkinter.c is supplied in the 2.0 subdirectory.
   Modify tkappinit.c in the Modules directory of the Python distribution.
   The modified tkappinit.c is supplied in the 2.0 subdirectory.
   These modified files can be used for Tkinter with or without Tix.
   
3) Modify the Modules/Setup file to link in the Tix library according
   to the comments in the file. On Linux this looks like

# *** Always uncomment this (leave the leading underscore in!):
 _tkinter _tkinter.c tkappinit.c -DWITH_APPINIT \
# *** Uncomment and edit to reflect where your Tcl/Tk headers are:
	-I/usr/local/src/tcl8.2.3/generic -I/usr/local/src/tk8.2.3/generic \
# *** Uncomment and edit to reflect where your X11 header files are:
	-I/usr/X11R6/include \
# *** Or uncomment this for Solaris:
#	-I/usr/openwin/include \
# *** Uncomment and edit for Tix extension only:
	-DWITH_TIX -I/usr/local/src/tix-8.1.1/generic -L/usr/local/src/tix-8.1.1/unix/tk8.2 -ltix8.1.8.2 \
# *** Uncomment and edit for BLT extension only:
#	-DWITH_BLT -I/usr/local/blt/blt8.0-unoff/include -lBLT8.0 \
# *** Uncomment and edit for PIL (TkImaging) extension only:
#	-DWITH_PIL -I../Extensions/Imaging/libImaging  tkImaging.c \
# *** Uncomment and edit for TOGL extension only:
#	-DWITH_TOGL togl.c \
# *** Uncomment and edit to reflect where your Tcl/Tk libraries are:
	-L/usr/local/src/tcl8.2.3/unix 	-L/usr/local/src/tk8.2.3/unix \
# *** Uncomment and edit to reflect your Tcl/Tk versions:
	-ltk8.2 -ltcl8.2 \
# *** Uncomment and edit to reflect where your X11 libraries are:
	-L/usr/X11R6/lib \
# *** Or uncomment this for Solaris:
#	-L/usr/openwin/lib \
# *** Uncomment these for TOGL extension only:
#	-lGL -lGLU -lXext -lXmu \
# *** Uncomment for AIX:
#	-lld \
# *** Always uncomment this; X11 libraries to link with:
	-lX11

4) Modify Tkinter.py in the Lib/lib-tk directory of the Python distribution.
   The modified Tkinter.py is supplied in the 2.0 subdirectory.
   This modified file can be used for Tkinter with or without Tix.

5) Copy Tix.py to the Lib/lib-tk directory of the Python distribution.

6) Rebuild Python and reinstall.

You should now have a working Tix implementation in Python. To see if all
is as it should be, run the 'tixwidgets.py' script in the demos directory.
