-----------------------

	CHANGES
	-------
	1) Made diffs against Python 2.0 and put them in the 2.0 subdirectory.
	2) Changed _tkinter.c to define TIX_VERSION and call Tix_Init.

	BUG FIXES

	of the root window (see the Python FAQ for an explanation).

PyTix version 1.12
------------------

	CHANGES
	-------
	1) Tkinter.py now only has the addition of the Form class since
	   the globalsetvar() etc. has been rolled into the 1.4 Tkinter
	
	BUG FIXES
	---------
	1) Fixed typo in TixWidgets.subwidgets_all()
	2) Fixed bug in TixWidgets.subwidgets_all where some Tix internal
	   widgets were causing an exception.

	   for a tree of subwidgets
	4) The label subwidget of the ComboBox was inadvertently left out
	5) The orientation option of a PanedWindow was not marked static

	
PyTix Version 1.11
-------------------

ADDITIONS
---------

Tix ver. 4.0.1 has enhanced HList functionality and an additional widget (Tree).
Tix.py V1.11 has been updated to reflect these changes as well. However,
it will still work with Tix v4.0 since there are no incompatible changes (only
additions).

A new DisplayStyle class has been added (thanks to Steffen Kremser). This
allows the user to create a display style and apply it to many items
subsequently (via the -style switch).

BUG FIXES
---------

0) In the __init__ methods for all the __dummy... Tix widgets, initialization
   of the subwidgets was missing in V1.1. Thanks to Guenter Kolousek for
   pointing this out.

1) Removed listbox child of ComboBox as result of (0). It can now be accessed
   as combobox.slistbox.listbox

2) The dirlist member in ExFileSelectBox was actually a DirList and not a
   ScrolledListBox.

3) The HList widget method 'column' was renamed and modified to 'column_width'

4) NoteBook.raised_page() renamed to NoteBook.raised()

5) Various other small bug fixes
