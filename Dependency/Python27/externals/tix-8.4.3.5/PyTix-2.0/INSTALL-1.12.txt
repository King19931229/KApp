Installing PyTix
----------------

0) To use PyTix, you need Tcl (V7.6), Tk (V4.2), Tix (V4.0.5) and Python (V1.4).
   PyTix has been written and tested on a Sun Sparc running Solaris 2.5
   with the above mentioned packages.

   Tcl7.5 and Tk4.1 should work just as well but I haven't tried it. If
   you are using Tcl7.4 and Tk4.0, there are bugs with the handling of
   compound images.

   There is nothing OS-specific in PyTix itself so it should work on
   any machine with Tix and Python installed.

1) Build and install Tcl 7.6, Tk 4.2 and Tix 4.0.5.
   Ensure that Tix is properly installed by running tixwish and executing
   the demo programs

   Note that Tix 4.0.5 does not compile with Tcl 7.6 / Tk 4.2 out of the
   box although it seems to compile and run OK. You might want to use
   Tcl 7.5/ Tk 4.1 instead.

2) Modify _tkinter.c in the Modules directory of the Python distribution.
   In the routine Tcl_AppInit(), add the following lines just after the
   block which calls to Tk_Init().

	  if (Tix_Init (interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
	    fprintf(stderr, "Tix_Init error: %s\n", interp->result);
	    return TCL_ERROR;
	  }

   The modified _tkinter.c is supplied.

3) Modify the Modules/Setup file to link in the Tix library. On Solaris,
   this looks like

	tkinter tkintermodule.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib \
		-ltix4.0-tk4.1 -ltk4.2 -ltcl7.6 -lX11

4) Copy Tix.py and the modified Tkinter.py to Lib/tkinter. If you have
   modified Tkinter for any reason, just apply the diffs by hand. There
   are only a few changes (see Tkinter.diff)

5) Rebuild Python and reinstall.

You should now have a working Tix implementation in Python. To see if all
is as it should be, run the 'tixwidgets.py' script in the demos directory.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please report them
to me.
