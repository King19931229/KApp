<H1><A NAME=1>1 Introduction</H1>

<p><H2><A NAME=1.1>1.1 What is Tix</H2>

<p><H3><A NAME=1.1.1>1.1.1 Tix for Application Programmers</H3>

<p>  The acronym Tix stands for Tk Interface Extension. Tix is different
  things for different people.

<p>  If you are a GUI application programmer, that is, if you earn a
  living by building graphical applications, you will appreciate Tix
  as a library of <i> mega-widgets</i>: widgets made out of other
  widgets. To use a crude analogy, if the widgets in the standard TK
  library are bricks and mortars for a builder, the mega-widgets in
  the Tix library are walls, windows or even pre-build kitchens. Of
  course, these ``bigger components'' are themselves made of bricks
  and mortars, but it will take much less effort to put them together
  than planting bricks on top of each other.

<p>  The Tix widgets not only help you speed up the development of your
  applications, they also help you in the design process. Since the
  standard Tk widgets are too primitive, they force you to think of
  your house as, by using the same analogy, millions of bricks. With
  the help of the Tix mega-widgets, you can design your application is
  a more structural and coherent manner.

<p>  Moreover, the Tix library provides a rich set of widgets. Figure
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1-1>1-1 </a> shows all Tix widgets -- there are more than 40
  of them! Although the standard Tk library has many useful widgets,
  they are far from complete. The Tix library provides most of the
  commonly needed widgets that are missing from standard Tk:
  FileSelectBox, ComboBox, Control (a.k.a. SpinBox) and an assortment
  of scroll-able widgets. Tix also includes many more widgets that are
  generally useful in a wide range of applications: NoteBook,
  FileEntry, PanedWindow, MDIWindow, etc.

<p>  With all these new widgets, you can introduce new interaction
  techniques into applications, creating more useful and more
  intuitive user interfaces.  You can design your application by
  choosing the most appropriate widgets to match the special needs of
  your application and users.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.1.2>1.1.2 Tix for Widget Developers</H3>

<p>  On the other hand, if you are a widget developer, Tix provides an
  object oriented programming environment, the Tix Intrinsics, that is
  carefully designed for the development of mega-widgets. If you have
  developed widgets in C, you will know how slow and painful such a
  process would be. In recognition of the difficulties in widget
  development, the Tix Intrinsics includes many tools that
  dramatically cuts down the efforts required to develop new widgets.
  With the Tix Intrinsics, the rapid prototyping/development of
  widgets is finally feasible: you can write a new widgets in the
  matter of hours or even minutes.

<p>  With the Tix Intrinsics, you widget code can readily become
  reusable.  Tix also provides a set of rules and mechanisms that
  allow you to develop widgets that are inter-operable with other
  widgets.

<p>  In Part I of this manual, we will talk about using the Tix widgets.
  The discussion of writing new Tix widgets will be carried out in
  Part II.

<p><H2><A NAME=1.2>1.2 Getting Started: the TixControl Widget</H2>

<p>  <i> Pre-requisites: you should be familiar with Tk widgets and
  programming, or read the Tk book along with this book</i>

<p>  Before delving into the deep philosophy of the Tix widgets, let us
  first have a quick example to demonstrate the usefulness and
  convenience of an Tix widget: the TixControl is basically an entry
  widget that displays a value. Next to the entry, there are two up
  and down arrow buttons for you to adjust the value inside the entry
  widget.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.2.1>1.2.1 Creating a TixControl Widget</H3>

<p>  The following code demonstrates how to create a TixControl widget and
  specify its options:

<p><pre>
    tixControl .lawyers -label Lawyers: -max 10 -min 0
    .lawyers config -integer true -step 2
</pre>
  This example creates a TixControl widget that let us to select the
  numbers of lawyers we wish to be allowed in this country.  (Figure
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1-2>1-2 </a>)

<p>  Let us examine the options: the <code> -label</code> option specifies a
  caption for this widget. The <code> -max</code> option specifies the maximum
  number of lawyers we can choose. The <code> -min</code> option specifies the
  minimum number of lawyers we can choose: although we would love to
  enter a negative number, reality dictate that the lower limit must
  be zero. The <code> -integer</code> option indicates that the number of
  lawyers must be an integer; that is, we respect the lawyers' rights
  not to be chopped up into decimal points. Finally, since lawyers
  seem to go in pairs, we set the <code> -step</code> option to <code> 2</code>, which
  indicates that when we press the up/down arrow buttons, we want the
  number of lawyers to go up and down by two each time.

<p>
<blockquote><a name=1-2>
<center><img src=fig/intro/lawyer.gif></center>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 1-2) The TixControl Widget</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>  As shown in the example, you can create and manipulate a Tix widget
  in the same manner as the standard Tk widgets. The options of the
  widget can be specified during the creation of the widget.
  Alternatively, they can be changed by the <code> configure</code> widget
  command.  In addition, options can also be specified in the option
  database or as X resources. Here is an example that produces the
  same result as the previous code fragment:

<p><pre>
    option add *lawyers.max 10
    option add *lawyers.min 0
    tixControl .lawyers -label Lawyers: -integer true
    .lawyers config -step 2
</pre>

<p>  <!ignored:nind> In figure <a href=intro.tex.html#1-3>1-3 </a>, you can see the composition of
  TixControl: it is made out of a label widget, an entry widget and
  two button widgets. Widgets that are composed of other widgets, like
  TixControl, are called <i> mega-widgets</i>. Most widgets in the Tix
  library are mega-widgets (xx: and as you know this book is about
  them!).

<p><blockquote><a name=1-3>

<hr><center><h3>(Figure 1-3) The Composition of TixControl</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=1.2.2>1.2.2 Accessing The Value of a TixControl Widget</H3>


<p>  The TixControl widget allows the user to input a value. There are
  several ways to read this value in your program. First of all,
  TixControl stores the current value in the <code> -value</code> option.  You
  can use query the <code> -value</code> option by calling the command

<p><pre>
    .c cget -value
</pre>

<p>  this command will return the current value of the tixContro widget
  <code> .c</code>.  The following command sets the value of the widget to a
  new number (100):

<p><pre>
    .c config -value 100
</pre>
  The second way to access the value of TixControl is to use the <code>
  -variable</code> option. This options instructs the TixControl widget to
  store the its value into a global variable so that you can read it
  at any time. Also, by assigning a new value to this global variable,
  you can change the value of the TixControl widget. Here is an
  example:

<p><pre>
    .c config -variable myvar
    set myvar 100
</pre>
  
  <!ignored:nind> In some situations, you may want to be informed immediately
  when the value of the TixControl widget changes. To accomplish this,
  you can use the <code> -command</code> option.  The following line causes
  the TCL procedure <code> valueChanged</code> to be called whenever the value
  of <code> .c</code> changes:

<p><pre>
    tixControl .c -command valueChanged
</pre>

<p><H4><A NAME=1.2.2.1> Disabling Callbacks Temporarily</H4>

<p>
  Now, if you want to change a value from within the program, you have
  to disable the callback. The reason is that the callback runs
  whenever you (as well as the user) makes a change. In particular, if
  you make a change within the callback procedure and forget to
  disable the callback, it will recursively call itself and enter an
  infinite loop. To avoid this problem, you should use the <code>
  -disablecallback</code> option. Here is an example:

<p><pre>
    tixControl .c -command addOne

<p>    proc addOne {value} {
        .c config -disablecallback true
        .c config -value [incr value]
        .c config -disablecallback false
    }
</pre>
  The procedure <code> addOne</code> adjusts the value of <code> .c</code> by one
  whenever the user enters a new value into <code> .c</code>. Notice that it
  is necessary to set <code> -disablecallback</code> here or otherwise <code>
  addOne</code> will be infinitely recursed! That is because <code> addOne</code> is
  called <i> every time</i> the value changes, either by the user or by
  the program.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.2.3>1.2.3 Validating User Inputs</H3>

<p>  Sometimes it may be necessary to check the user input against
  certain criteria. For example, you may want to allow only even
  numbers in a TixControl widget. To do this, you can use the <code>
  -validatecmd</code> option, which specifies a Tcl command to call whenever
  the user enters a new value. Here is an example:

<p><pre>
    tixControl .c -value 0 -step 2 -validatecmd evenOnly

<p>    proc evenOnly {value} {
        return [expr $value - ($value %2)]
    }
</pre>
  The value parameter to <code> evenOnly</code> is the new value entered by
  the user.  The <code> evenOnly</code> procedure makes sure that the new
  value is even by returning a modified, even number. The Tcl command
  specified by the <code> -validatecmd</code> must return a value which it
  deems valid and this value will be stored in the <code> -value</code> option
  of the TixControl widget.

<p>
<H2><A NAME=1.3>1.3 Accessing The Components Inside Mega Widgets</H2>

<p><H3><A NAME=1.3.1>1.3.1 Subwidgets</H3>

<p>  As we have seen in section <a href=intro.tex.html#1.2.1>1.2.1 </a>, the TixControl
  widget is composed of several widgets: one label widget, one entry
  widget and two button widgets. These ``widgets inside mega-widgets''
  are called <i> subwidgets</i> in the Tix terminology. We will often
  have the need to access these subwidgets. For example, sometimes we
  need to change the configuration options of the subwidgets. In other
  cases, we may need to interact with the subwidgets directly.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.3.2>1.3.2 Subwidget Names</H3>

<p>  Each subwidget inside a mega is identified by a <i> subwidget
  name</i>. Naturally, the label and entry subwidgets inside a TixSelect
  widget are called <code> label</code> and <code> entry</code>, respectively. The two
  button widgets are called <code> incr</code> and <code> decr</code> because they are
  used to <code> incr</code>ement and <code> decr</code>ement the value inside the
  TixControl widget (see figure <a href=intro.tex.html#1-4>1-4 </a>).

<p><blockquote><a name=1-4>
<center><img src=fig/intro/ctl_subw.gif></center>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 1-4) Subwidgets inside TixControl Widget</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>
<H3><A NAME=1.3.3>1.3.3 The <code> subwidget</code> Method</H3>

<p>  All Tix mega-widgets support the <code> subwidget</code> method. This method
  takes at least one argument, the name of a subwidget. When you pass
  only one argument to this method, it returns the pathname of the
  subwidget which is identified by that name. For example, if .c is
  the pathname of a TixControl widget, the command:

<p><blockquote><pre>
  .c subwidget entry
</pre></blockquote>
  returns the pathname of the <code> entry</code> subwidget, which is <code>
  .c.frame.entry</code> in this case.

<p>  If you call the <code> subwidget</code> method with additional arguments,
  the widget command of the specified subwidget will be called with
  these arguments. For example, if <code> .c</code> is, again, the pathname of
  a TixControl widget, the command:

<p><blockquote><pre>
  .c subwidget entry configure -bg gray
</pre></blockquote>
  will cause the widget command of the <code> entry</code> subwidget of <code>
  .c</code> to be called with the arguments <code> configure -bg gray</code>. So
  actually this command will be translated into the following call:

<p><blockquote><pre>
  .c.frame.entry configure -bg gray
</pre></blockquote>
  which calls the <code> configure</code> method of the <code> entry</code> subwidget
  with the arguments <code> -bg gray</code> and changes its background color
  to <code> gray</code>.

<p>  We can call the <code> subwidget</code> method with other types of arguments
  to access different methods of the specified subwidget. For example,
  the following call:

<p><blockquote><pre>
  .c subwidget entry icursor end
</pre></blockquote>
  calls the <code> icursor</code> method of the <code> entry</code> subwidget with the
  argument <code> end</code> and sets the insert cursor of the <code> entry</code>
  subwidget to the end of its input string.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.3.4>1.3.4 Chaining the <code> subwidget</code> Method</H3>

<p>  Some Tix mega-widgets may have subwidgets that in turn contain
  subwidgets. For example, the TixExFileSelectDialog (section
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5.1.3>5.1.3 </a>) widget contains a TixExFileSelectBox subwidget
  called <code> fsbox</code>, which in turn contains a TixComboBox (section
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1.4>1.4 </a>) subwidget called <code> dir</code>. If we want to access
  the <code> dir</code> subwidget, we can just ``chain'' the <code> subwidget</code>
  method. For example, if we have a TixExFileSelectDialog called <code>
  .file</code>, the following command will return the pathname of the <code>
  dir</code> subwidget of the <code> fsbox</code> subwidget of <code> .file</code>:

<p><blockquote><pre>
  .file subwidget fsbox subwidget dir
</pre></blockquote>
  Moreover, the following command configures the <code> dir</code> subwidget to
  have a border of the groove type with a border width of 2 pixels:

<p><blockquote><pre>
  .file subwidget fsbox subwidget dir configure -bd 2 -relief groove
</pre></blockquote>

<p>  The chaining of the subwidget command can be applied for arbitrarily
  many levels, depending whether your widget has a subwidget that has
  a subwidget that has a subwidget that has a subwidget ... and so on.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.3.5>1.3.5 Configuring Subwidget Options Using the <code> -options</code> Switch</H3>

<p>  As we have seen above, we can use commands like ``<code> subwidget</code>
  <i> name</i> <code> configure ...</code>'' to set the configuration options
  of subwidgets. However, this can get quite tedious if we want to
  configure many options of many subwidgets.

<p>  There is a more convenient and terse way to configure the subwidget
  options without using the <code> subwidget</code> method: the <code> -options</code>
  switch. All Tix mega-widgets support the <code> -option</code> switch, which
  can be used during the creation of the mega-widget.

<p><blockquote><a name=1-5>
<blockquote><pre>
tixControl .income -label "Income: " -variable income -options {
    label.width       8
    label.anchor      e
    entry.width       10
    entry.borderWidth 3
}
tixControl .age    -label "Age: "    -variable age    -options {
    label.width       8
    label.anchor      e
    entry.width       10
    entry.borderWidth 3
}
pack .income .age -side top
</pre></blockquote>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 1-5) Using the <code> -options</code> switch</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>

 </TR></TABLE></center>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 1-6) Using the <code> -options</code> Switch to Align the Labels</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The use of the <code> -options</code> switch is illustrated in program
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1-5>1-5 </a>, which creates two TixControl widgets for
  the user to enter his income and age. Because of the different sizes
  of the labels of these two widgets, if we create them haphazardly,
  the output may look like fig <a href=intro.tex.html#1-6>1-6 </a>.

<p>  To avoid this problem, we set the width of the <code> label</code>
  subwidgets of the <code> .income</code> and <code> .age</code> widgets to be the
  same (8 characters wide) and set their <code> -anchor</code> option to <code>
  e</code> (flushed to right), so that the labels appear to be
  well-aligned. Program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-5>1-5 </a> also does other
  things such as setting the <code> entry</code> subwidgets to have a width of
  10 characters and a border-width of 3 pixels so that they appear
  wider and ``deeper''. A better result is shown in figure
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1-6>1-6 </a>.
  
  As we can see from program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-5>1-5 </a>, the value for
  the <code> -options</code> switch is a list of one or more pairs of

<p><blockquote>
  <i> subwidget-option-spec</i> <i> value</i> ..
</blockquote>

<p> <i> subwidget-option-spec</i> is in the form <i> subwidget-name</i><code>
 .</code><i> option-name</i>. For example, <code> label.anchor</code> identifies the
 <code> anchor</code> option of the <code> label</code> subwidget, <code> entry.width</code>
 identifies the <code> width</code> option of the entry subwidget, and so on.

<p> Notice we must use the <i> name</i> of the option, not the <i>
 command-line switch</i> of the option. For example, the option that
 specifies the border-width of the <code> entry</code> subwidget has the
 command-line switch <code> -borderwidth</code> but its name is <code>
 borderWidth</code> (notice the capitalization on the name but not on the
 command-line switch). Therefore, we have used the capitalized version
 of ``<code> entry.borderWidth 3</code>'' in program
 <a href=intro.tex.html#1-5>1-5 </a> and not ``<code> entry.borderwidth 3</code>''. To
 find out the names of the options of the respective subwidgets,
 please refer to their manual pages.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.3.6>1.3.6 Configuring Subwidget Options Using the Tk Option Database</H3>

<p>  The <code> -options</code> switch is good if you want to specify subwidget
  options for one or a few mega-widgets. If you want to specify the
  subwidget for many mega-widgets, it is easier to use the Tk Option
  Database.

<p>  Options in the Tk Option Database can be specified using the <code>
  option</code> command and the pathname of the widget. For all the Tix
  mega-widgets, it is guaranteed that the pathname of their subwidgets
  ends with the <i> name</i> of the subwidgets. For example, if we have
  a mega widget called <code> .a.b.megaw</code> and it has a subwidget whose
  name is <code> subw</code>, then we can be sure that the pathname of the
  subwidget will be something like

<p><blockquote><pre>
  .a.b.megaw.foo.bar.subw
</pre></blockquote>
  Therefore, if we want to specify options for it in the Option
  Database, we can issue commands like:

<p><blockquote><pre>
  option add *a.b.megaw*subw.option1 value1
  option add *a.b.megaw*subw.option2 value2
</pre></blockquote>
  Notice that it will be wrong to issue the commands as:

<p><blockquote><pre>
  option add *a.b.megaw.subw.option1 value1
  option add *a.b.megaw.subw.option2 value2
</pre></blockquote>
  because in general we will not know whether the subwidget is an
  immediate child window of <code> .a.b.megaw</code> (<i>such a decision
  is left to the mega-widget implementor and may vary in different
  versions of the same mega-widget</i>).

<p>  Program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-7>1-7 </a> demonstrates how the Tk Option
  Database can be used to achieve the same effect as program
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1-5>1-5 </a>.

<p><blockquote><a name=1-7>
<blockquote><pre>
option add *TixControl*label.width       8
option add *TixControl*label.anchor      e
option add *TixControl*entry.width       10
option add *TixControl*entry.borderWidth 3

<p>tixControl .income -label "Income: " -variable income
tixControl .age    -label "Age: "    -variable age

<p>pack .income .age -side top
</pre></blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=1.3.7>1.3.7 Caution: Restricted Access</H3>

<p>  In the current implementation of Tix, there is no limits on how you
  can access the options of the subwidgets. However, many options of
  the subwidgets may be already used by the mega-widget in special
  ways. For example, the <code> -textvariable</code> option of the <code> entry</code>
  subwidget of TixControl may be used to store some private
  information for the mega widget. Therefore, you should access the
  options of the subwidgets with great care. In general you should
  only access those options that affect the appearance of the
  subwidgets (such as <code> -font</code> or <code> -foreground</code>) and leave
  everything else intact. (<i></i>) { In future versions of Tix, there
  will be explicit restrictions on which subwidget options you can
  access. Errors will be generated if you try to access restricted
  subwidget options}

<p>

<p><H2><A NAME=1.4>1.4 Another Tix Widget: TixComboBox</H2>

<p>  The <i> TixComboBox</i> widget is very similar to the ComboBox widgets
  available in MS Windows and Motif 2.0. A TixComboBox consists of an
  entry widget and a listbox widget. Usually, the ComboBox contains a
  list of possible values for the user to select. The user may also
  choose an alternative value by typing it in the entry widget. Figure
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1-8>1-8 </a> shows two ComboBoxes for the user to choose fonts and
  character sizes. You can see fro the figure that a listbox is popped
  down from the ComboBox for fonts for the user to choose among a list
  of possible fonts.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.4.1>1.4.1 Creating a TixComboBox Widget</H3>

<p><blockquote><a name=1-9>
<blockquote><pre>

.c insert end cat
.c insert end dog
.c insert end pig
</pre></blockquote>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 1-9) Creating a ComboBox</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>  In program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-9>1-9 </a>, we set up a ComboBox <code> .c</code>
  for the user to select an animal to play with. If the user is just a
  dull person like you and me, he would just press the arrow button
  and select a pre-designated animal such as ``dog''.  However, if he
  wants to try something new, he could type ``micky'' or ``sloth''
  into the entry widget and he will get to play with his favorite
  animal.

<p>  Of course, sometimes we don't want too many sloths around us and we
  want to limit the range of the user's selections. In this case we
  can do one of two things. First, we can set the <code> -editable</code>
  option to <code> false</code> so that the user cannot type in the entry
  widget at all.  Alternatively, we can use the <code> -validatecmd</code>
  option (see section <a href=intro.tex.html#1.4.3>1.4.3 </a>) to check input the input.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.4.2>1.4.2 Controlling the Style of the TixComboBox</H3>

<p>  The TixComboBox widget can appear in many different styles. If we
  set the <code> -dropdown</code> option to <code> true</code> (which is the default),
  the listbox will only appear when the user presses the arrow button.
  When <code> -dropdown</code> is set to <code> false</code>, the listbox is always
  shown and the arrow button will disappear because it is not needed
  anymore.

<p>  There is also an option called <code> -fancy</code>. It is set to <code>
  false</code> by default. When set to <code> true</code>, a tick button and a cross
  button will appear next to the entry widget. The tick button allows
  you to select again the value that's already in the ComboBox. If you
  press the cross button, the entry widget will be cleared.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.4.3>1.4.3 Static Options</H3>

<p>  The <code> -dropdown</code> and <code> -fancy</code> options are so-called ``static
  options''.  They can only be set during the creation of the
  ComboBox. Hence this code is valid:

<p><pre>
    tixComboBox .c -dropdown true
</pre>

<p>  But the following code will generate an error because it attempts to
  set the <code> -dropdown</code> option <i> after</i> the ComboBox has already
  been created.

<p><pre>
    TixComboBox .c
    .c config -dropdown true
</pre>

<p>  The restrictions of the static options, although annoying,
  nevertheless make sense because we don't want our interface to
  suddenly change its style. If sometimes a button is there and
  sometimes it disappear all by itself, that will certainly create a
  lot of confusion and makes the user wonder why he should buy our
  software. Also, as you will see in chapter <a href=oop.tex.html#6>6 </a>, having some
  static options will make the life of widget writers a lot easier.

<p>  Accessing the value of the ComboBox is very similar to accessing the
  value of the TixControl widget. The ComboBox has these four options,
  which we discussed in section <a href=intro.tex.html#1.2.2>1.2.2 </a>: <code> -value</code>,
  <code> -variable</code>, <code> -command</code> and <code> -validatecmd</code>. You can use
  these four options to access the user input and respond to user
  actions in exactly the same way as discussed in section
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1.2.2>1.2.2 </a>.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.4.4>1.4.4 Monitoring the User's Browsing Actions</H3>

<p>  When the user drags the mouse pointer over the listbox, the listbox
  item under the pointer will be highlighted and a ``browse event''
  will be generated. If you want to keep track of what items the user
  has browses through, you can use the <code> -browsecmd</code> option. Here
  is an example:

<p><pre>
    tixComboBox .c -browsecmd mybrowse
    ....

<p>    proc mybrowse {item} {
        puts "user has browsed $item"
    }
</pre>

<p>  When the Tcl command specified by the <code> -browsecmd</code> option is
  called, it will be called with one parameter: the current item that
  the user has highlighted.

<p>  The <code> -browsecmd</code> is useful because it gives the user the
  possibility of temporarily seeing the results of several choices
  before committing to a final choice.

<p>  For example, we can list a set of image files in a ComboBox. When
  the user single-clicks on an item on the ComboBox, we want to show a
  simplified view of that image. After the user has browsed through
  several images, he can finally decide on which image he wants by
  double-clicking on that item in the listbox.

<p>  The following is some pseudo Tcl code that does this. Please notice
  that the <code> -browsecmd</code> procedure is called every time the user
  single-clicks on an item or drags the mouse pointer in the listbox.
  The <code> -command</code> procedure is only called when the user
  double-clicks on an item.

<p><pre>
tixComboBox .c -dropdown false -browsecmd show_simple -command load_fullsize 
.c insert end "/pkg/images/flowers.gif"
.c insert end "/pkg/images/jimmy.gif"
.c insert end "/pkg/images/ncsa.gif"

<p>proc show_simple {filename} {
    # Load in a simplified version of $filename
}

<p>proc load_fullsize {filename} {
    # Load in the full size image in $filename
}
</pre>

<p>  As we shall see, all Tix widgets that let us do some sort of
  selections have the <code> -browsecmd</code> option. The <code> -browsecmd</code>
  option allows us to respond to user events in a simple,
  straight-forward manner. Of course, you can do the same thing with
  the Tk <code> bind</code> command, but you don't want to do that unless you
  are very fond of things like <code> &lt;Control-Shift-ButtonRelease-1&gt;</code>
  and <code> "%x %X $w %W %w"</code>.

<p><H2><A NAME=1.5>1.5 The TixSelect Widget</H2>

<p>  The TixSelect widget figure <a href=intro.tex.html#1-10>1-10 </a> provides you the same
  kind of facility that is available with the Tk <code> radiobutton</code> and
  <code> checkbutton</code> widgets. That is, TixSelect allows the user to
  select one or a few values out of many choices. However, TixSelect
  is superior because it allows you to layout the choices in much less
  space than what is required by the Tk <code> radiobutton</code>
  widgets. Also, TixSelect supports complicated selection
  rules. Because of these reasons, TixSelect is a primary choice for
  implementing toolbar buttons, which often have strict space
  requirements and complicated selection rules.

<p><H4><A NAME=1.5.1.1> Label and Orientation</H4>

<p>  As shown in program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-11>1-11 </a>, with the <code> -label</code>
  option, we can put a label next to the button subwidgets as the
  caption of the TixSelect widget. We can also control the layout of
  the button subwidgets using the <code> -orientation</code> option. The <code>
  -orientation</code> option can have two values: <code> horizontal</code> (the
  default value) or <code> vertical</code>, and the buttons are lied up
  accordingly. Figure <a href=intro.tex.html#1-12>1-12 </a> shows the output of a
  TixSelect widget whose <code> -orientation</code> is set to <code> vertical</code>.

<p><H4><A NAME=1.5.1.2> Creating the Button Subwidgets and Configuring
Their Appearance</H4>

<p>  After we have created the TixSelect widget, we can create the button
  subwidgets inside the TixSelect widget by the <code> add</code> widget
  command (lines 2-4 of program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-11>1-11 </a>).

<p>  The first argument to the <code> add</code> command is the name of the
  button subwidget. Additional arguments can be given in <i>
  option-value</i> pairs to configure the appearance of the button
  subwidget. These <i> option-value</i> pairs can be any of those
  accepted by a normal TK button widget. As shown in program
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1-11>1-11 </a>, we use the <code> -text</code> option to put
  appropriate text strings over the three button subwidgets.

<p>  Notice that we also set the <code> -width</code> option of all the button
  subwidgets to 6 characters. This way, the three buttons will have
  the same width. If we didn't set the <code> -width</code> option for the
  button widgets, they will have different widths, depending on their
  text string, and the result would look less esthetically pleasing
  than buttons with same widths.

<p>  The output of program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-11>1-11 </a> is shown in figure

<p><H4><A NAME=1.5.1.3> Accessing the Button Subwidgets</H4>

<p>  We have already seen the concept of subwidgets and how they can be
  accessed in section <a href=intro.tex.html#1.3.1>1.3.1 </a> --- when we create a Tix
  mega-widget, some subwidgets are created for us automatically. For
  example, the label and entry subwidgets inside a TixControl widget.
  We can access these subwidgets in a multitude of ways, including
  using the subwidget method.

<p>  One thing about the subwidgets we saw in section
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1.3.1>1.3.1 </a> is that they are ``static'', meaning they are
  created when the mega-widget is created and they remain there for
  the whole lifetime of the mega-widget.

<p>  The TixSelect widget takes us to a new concept: <i> dynamic
  subwidgets</i> are subwidgets that can be created on-the-fly. After we
  add a new button into the TixSelect widget, we get a new
  subwidget. The name of this new subwidget is given by the first
  parameter passed to the <code> add</code> method. As the following code
  demonstrates, we can access this new subwidget using the <code>
  subwidget</code> method:

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixSelect .s
.s add apple  -text Apple
.s add orange -text Orange
#   Mmmm..., let's make the widget look more educated
#   by using French words
.s subwidget apple  config -text Pomme
.s subwidget orange config -text Orange
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<H3><A NAME=1.5.2>1.5.2 Specifying Selection Rules</H3>

<p>  For simple selection rules, you can use the <code> -allowzero</code> and
  <code> -radio</code> options. The <code> -allowzero</code> option specifies whether
  the user can select none of the choices inside the TixSelect
  widget. The <code> -radio</code> option controls how many buttons can be
  selected at once: when set to true, the user can select only one
  button at a time; when set to false, the user can select as many
  buttons as he desires.

<p>  With these two options, we can write a program using two TixSelect
  widgets for little Jimmy to fill up his lunch box. On the Sandwich
  side, we set <code> -radio</code> to true and <code> -allowzero</code> <code>
  false</code>. That means Jimmy can select one and only one sandwich among
  beef, cheese or ham sandwiches. On the Veggie side, we want to
  encourage Jimmy to consume as much veggie as possible, so we set the
  <code> -allowzero</code> option to <code> false</code>. We also set the <code>
  -allowzero</code> option to <code> false</code> so that Jimmy cannot get away with
  eating none of the vegetables (see program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-13>1-13 </a>).

<p><blockquote><a name=1-13>
<blockquote><pre>
tixSelect .sandwich -allowzero false -radio true -label "Sandwich :"
.sandwich add beef   -text Beef
.sandwich add cheese -text Cheese
.sandwich add ham    -text Ham

<p>tixSelect .vege -allowzero false -radio false -label "Vegetable :"
.vege add bean    -text Bean
.vege add carrot  -text Carrot
.vege add lettuce -text Lettuce

<p>
<H3><A NAME=1.5.3>1.5.3 Accessing the Value of a TixSelect Widget</H3>

<p>  The <i> value</i> of a TixSelect widget is a list of the names of the
  button subwidgets that are currently selected. For example, in
  program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-11>1-11 </a>, if the user has selected the apple
  button, then the value of the TixSelect widget will be <code>
  apple</code>. If the user has selected both the apple and the orange
  buttons, then the value will be the list <code> "apple orange"</code>.

<p>  The TixSelect widget supports same set of options as the TixControl
  widget for you to access its value: the <code> -value</code> option stores
  the current value, which can be queried and modified using the cget
  and configure methods. You can also use the <code> -variable</code> option
  to specify a global variable to store the value of the TixSelect
  widget. The <code> -command</code> option specifies a TCL command to be
  called whenever the user changes the selection inside a TixSelect
  widget. This command is called with one argument: the new value of
  the TixSelect widget. There is also the <code> -disablecallback</code>
  option which you can use to control whether the command specified by
  the <code> -command</code> option should be called when the value of the
  TixSelect changes.

<p><H3><A NAME=1.5.4>1.5.4 Specifying Complex Selection Rules</H3>

<p>  If you want to have more complex selection rules for the
  TixSelect widget, you can use the <code> -validatecmd</code> option. This
  option works the same as the <code> -validatecmd</code> option of the
  TixControl widget which we discusses in section
  <a href=intro.tex.html#1.2>1.2 </a>: it specifies a command to be called every
  time the user attempts to change the selection inside a TixSelect
  widget.

<p>  In the example program <a href=intro.tex.html#1-14>1-14 </a>, the procedure
  <code> TwoMax</code> will be called every time the user tries to change the
  selection of the <code> .fruits</code> widget. <code> TwoMax</code> limits the
  maximum number of fruits that the user to choose to be 2 by always
  truncating the value of the TixSelect widget to have no more than
  two items. If you run this program, you will find out that you can
  never select a third fruit after you have select two fruits.

<p><blockquote><a name=1-14>
<pre>
  tixSelect .fruits -label "Fruits: " -radio false -validatecmd TwoMax
  .fruits add apple  -text Apple  -width 6
  .fruits add orange -text Orange -width 6
  .fruits add banana -text Banana -width 6
  pack .fruits

<p>  proc TwoMax {value} {
     if {[llength $value] &gt; 2} {
        return [lrange $value 0 1]
     } else {
        return $value
     }
  }
