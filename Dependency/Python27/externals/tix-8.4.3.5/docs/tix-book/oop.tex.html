<H1><A NAME=6>6 Tix Object Oriented Programming</H1>

<p>  <i> This chapter is intended for experienced programmers who want to
  create new Tix widgets. If you just want use the Tix widgets in your
  applications, you can skip this chapter.</i>

<p><H2><A NAME=6.1>6.1 Introduction to Tix Object Oriented Programming</H2>

<p>  Tix comes with a simple object oriented programming (OOP) framework,
  the <i> Tix Intrinsics</i>, for writing mega-widgets. The Tix
  Intrinsics is not a general purpose OOP system and it does not
  support some features found in general purpose OOP systems such as
  <code> [incr Tcl]</code>. However, the Tix Intrinsics is specially designed
  for writing mega-widgets. It provides a simple and efficient
  interface for creating mega-widgets so that you can avoid the
  complexity and overheads of the general purpose OOP extensions to
  Tcl.

<p>  The hard thing about programming with mega-widgets is to make sure
  that each instance you create can handle its own activities.  Events
  must be directed to the right widget, procedures must act on data
  that is internal to that widget, and users should be able to change
  the options associated with the widget.  For instance, we'll show an
  arrow widget that needs to know what direction it's pointing; this
  requires each instance of the widget to have its own variable.

<p>  Furthermore, each widget should respond properly to changes
  requested by the application programmer during the program's run.
  The whole reason people use Tcl/Tk is because they can alter things
  on the fly.

<p>  The advantage of an object-oriented programming system is that you
  can easily associate a widget with its own data and procedures
  (methods).  This chapter shows how to do that, and how to configure
  data both at the time the widget is initialized and later during the
  program.

<p>
<H3><A NAME=6.1.1>6.1.1 Widget Classes and Widget Instances</H3>

<p>  All the mega-widget classes in Tix, such as TixComboBox and
  TixControl, are implemented in the Tix Intrinsics framework. Also,
  you can write new <i> widget classes</i> with the Tix Intrinsics. In
  the next section, I'll go through all the steps of creating a new
  widget class in Tix. I'll illustrate the idea using a new class
  ``TixArrowButton'' as an example. TixArrowButton is essentially a
  button that can display an arrow in one of the for directions
  (see figure <a href=oop.tex.html#6-1>6-1 </a>).

<p><blockquote><a name=6-1>
<center><img src=fig/oop/arrows.gif></center>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 6-1) Arrow Buttons</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>  Once you have defined your classes, you can create <i> widget
  instances</i> of these classes. For example, the following code will
  create four instances of your new TixArrowButton class:

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixArrowButton .up    -direction n
tixArrowButton .left  -direction e
tixArrowButton .right -direction w
tixArrowButton .down  -direction s
</pre></blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=6.1.2>6.1.2 What is in a Widget Instance</H3>

<p>  Each widget instance is composed of three integral parts: variables,
  methods and component widgets

<p><H4><A NAME=6.1.2.1> Variables</H4>

<p>  Each widget instance is associated with a set of variables. In the
  example of an instance of the TixArrowButton class, we may use a
  variable to store the direction to which the arrow is pointing
  to. We may also use a variable to count how many times the user has
  pressed the button.

<p>  Each variable can be public or private. Public variables may be
  accessed by the application programmer (usually via <code> configure</code>
  or cget <code> methods</code>) and their names usually start with a dash
  (<code> -</code>). They usually are used to represent some user-configurable
  options of the widget instance. Private variables, on the other
  hand, cannot be accessed by the application programmer. They are
  usually used to store information about the widget instance that are
  of interests only to the widget writer.

<p>  All the variables of an instance are stored in a global array that
  has the same name as the instance. For example, the variables of the
  instance <code> .up</code> are stored in the global array <code> .up:</code>. The
  public variable <code> -direction</code>, which records the direction to
  which the arrow is pointing to, is stored in <code> .up(-direction)</code>.
  The private variable <code> count</code>, which counts how many times the
  user has pressed the button, is stored in <code> .up(count)</code>. In
  comparison, the same variables of the <code> .down</code> instance are
  stored in <code> .down(-direction)</code> and <code> .down(count)</code>.

<p><H4><A NAME=6.1.2.2> Methods</H4>

<p>  To carry out operations on the widget, you define a set of
  procedures called <i> methods</i> (to use common object-oriented
  terminology). Each method can be declared as public or private. <i>
  Public methods</i> can be called by the application programmer. For
  example, if the TixArrowButton class supports the public methods
  <code> invoke</code> and <code> invert</code>, the application programmer can issue
  the commands to call these method for the widget instance <code> .up</code>.

<p><blockquote><pre>
.up invert
.up invoke
</pre></blockquote>
  In contrast, <i> Private methods</i> are of interests only to widget
  writers and cannot be called by application programmers.

<p><H4><A NAME=6.1.2.3> Component Widgets</H4>

<p>  A Tix mega-widget is composed of one or more component
  widgets. The main part of a mega-widget is called the <i> root
  widget</i>, which is usually a frame widget that encompasses all other
  component widgets. The other component widgets are called <i>
  subwidgets</i>.

<p>  The root widget has the same name as the the mega-widget itself. In
  the above example, we have a mega-widget called <code> .up</code>. It has a
  root widget which is a frame widget and is also called <code>
  .up</code>. Inside <code> .up</code> we have a button subwidget called <code>
  .up.button</code>.

<p>  Similar to variables and methods, component widgets are also
  classified into public and private component widgets. Only public
  widgets may be accessed by the application programmer, via the <code>
  subwidget</code> method (see section <a href=intro.tex.html#1.3.1>1.3.1 </a>) of each widget
  instance.

<p><H2><A NAME=6.2>6.2 Widget Class Declaration</H2>

<p>  The first step of writing a new widget class is to decide the base
  class from which the new class. Usually, if the new class does not
  share any common features with other classes, it should be derived
  from the TixPrimitive class. If it does share common features with
  other classes, then it should be derived from the appropriate base
  class. For example, if the new class support scrollbars, it should
  be derived from TixScrolledWidget; if it displays a label next to
  its ``main area'', then it should be derived from TixLabelWidget.

<p>  In the case of our new TixArrowButton class, it doesn't really share
  any common features with other classes, so we decide to use the base
  class TixPrimitive as its superclass.

<p>
<H3><A NAME=6.2.1>6.2.1 Using the tixWidgetClass Command</H3>

<p>  We can use the <code> tixWidgetClass</code> command to declare a new
  class. The syntax is:

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixWidgetClass classCommandName {
    -switch value
    -switch value
    ....
}
</pre></blockquote>
  For example, the following is the declaration section of
  TixArrowButton:

<p><blockquote><a name=6-2>
<pre>
tixWidgetClass tixArrowButton {
    -classname  TixArrowButton
    -superclass tixPrimitive
    -method {
        flash invoke invert
    }
    -flag {
        -direction -state
    }
    -configspec {
        {-direction direction Direction e}
        {-state state State normal}
    }
    -alias {
        {-dir -direction}
    }
    -default {
        {*Button.anchor         c}
        {*Button.padX           5}
    }
}
</pre>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 6-2) declaration of the TixArrowButton Class</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>  We'll look at what each option means as I describe the command in
  the following sections.

<p>  The first argument for <code> tixWidgetClass</code> is the <i> command
  name</i> for the widget class (<code> tixArrowButton</code>). Command names are
  used to create widgets of this class. For example, the code

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixArrowButton .arrow
</pre></blockquote>
  creates a widget instance <code> .arrow</code> of the class
  TixArrowButton. Also, the command name is used as a prefix of all
  the methods of this class. For example, the <code> Foo</code> and <code> Bar</code>
  methods of the class TixArrowButton will be written as <code>
  tixArrowButton:Foo</code> and <code> tixArrowButton:Bar</code>.

<p>  The <i> class name</i> of the class (<code> TixArrowButton</code>)is specified
  by the <code> -classname</code> switch inside the main body of the
  declaration. The class name is used only to specify options in the
  TK option database. For example, the following commands specifies
  the TixArrowButton widget instances should have the default value
  <code> up</code> for their <code> -direction</code> option and the default value
  <code> normal</code> for their <code> -state</code> option.

<p><blockquote><pre>
option add *TixArrowButton.direction up
option add *TixArrowButton.state     normal
</pre></blockquote>

<p>  <!ignored:nind> Notice the difference in the capitalization of the class name
  and the command name of the TixArrowButton class: both of them has
  the individual words capitalized, but the command name (<code>
  tixArrowButton</code>)starts with a lower case letter while the class name
  (<code> TixArrowButton</code>) starts with an upper case letter. When you
  create your own classes, you should follow this naming convention.

<p>
  The <code> -superclass</code> switch specifies the superclass of the new
  widget. In our example, we have set it to <code> tixPrimitive</code>. Again,
  pay attention to the capitalization: we should use the command name
  of the superclass, not its class name.

<p><H2><A NAME=6.3>6.3 Writing Methods</H2>

<p>  After we have declared the new widget class, we can write methods
  for this class to define its behavior. Methods are just a special
  type of TCL procedures and they are created by the <code> proc</code>
  command. There are, however, three requirements for methods. First,
  their names must be prefixed by the command name of their
  class. Second, they must accept at least one argument and the first
  argument that they accept must be called <code> w</code>. Third, the first
  command executed inside each method must be 

<p><blockquote><pre>
upvar #0 $w data
</pre></blockquote>

<p>  For example, the following is an implementation of the invert method
  for the class TixArrowButton:

<p><blockquote><pre>
proc tixArrowButton:invert {w} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    set curDirection $data(-direction)
    case $curDirection {
        n {
            set newDirection s
        }
        s {
            set newDirection n
        }
        # ....
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
  Notice that the name of the method is prefixed by the command name
  of the class (<code> tixArrowButton</code>). Also, the first and only
  argument that it accepts is <code> w</code> and the first line it executes
  is ``<code> upvar #0 $w data</code>''.

<p>  The argument <code> w</code> specifies which widget instance this method
  should act upon. For example, if the user has issued the command

<p><blockquote><pre>
.up invert
</pre></blockquote>
  on an instance <code> .up</code> of the class tixArrowButton, the method
  <code> tixArrowButton:invert</code> will be called and the argument <code> w</code>
  will have the value <code> .up</code>.

<p>  The <code> invert</code> method is used to invert the direction of the
  arrow. Therefore, it should examine the variable <code>
  .up(-direction)</code>, which stores the current direction of the instance
  <code> .up</code>, and modify it appropriately. It turns out that in TCL,
  the only clean way to access an array whose name is stored in a
  variable is the ``<code> upvar #0 $w data</code>'' technique: essentially
  it tells the intepreter that the array data should be an alias for
  the global array whose name is stored in <code> $w</code>. We will soon see
  how the widget's methods use the data array.

<p>  Once the mysterious ``<code> upvar #0 $w data</code>'' line is explained,
  it becomes clear what the rest of the <code> tixArrowButton:invert</code>
  method does: it examines the current direction of the arrow, which
  is stored in <code> $data(-direction)</code> and inverts it.

<p><H3><A NAME=6.3.1>6.3.1 Declaring Public Methods</H3>

<p>  All the methods of a class are by default private methods and cannot
  be accessed by the application programmer. If you want to make a
  method public, you can include its name in the <code> -method</code> section
  of the class declaration. In our TixArrowButton example, we have
  declared that the methods <code> flash</code>, <code> invert</code> and <code> invoke</code>
  are public methods and they can be accessed by the application
  programmer. All other methods of the TixArrowButton class will be
  private.

<p>  Usually, the names of private methods start with a capital letter
  with individual words capitalized. The names of public methods
  start with a lowercase letter.

<p><H2><A NAME=6.4>6.4 Standard Initialization Methods</H2>

<p>  Each new mega-widget class must supply three standard initialization
  methods.  When an instance of a Tix widget is created, three
  three methods will be called to initialize this instance. The
  methods are <code> InitWidgetRec</code>, <code> ConstructWidget</code> and <code>
  SetBindings</code> and they will be called in that order. The following
  sections show how these methods can be implemented.

<p><H3><A NAME=6.4.1>6.4.1 The InitWidgetRec Method</H3>

<p>  The purpose of the <code> InitWidgetRec</code> method is to initialize the
  variables of the widget instance. For example, the following
  implementation of <code> tixArrowButton:InitWidgetRec</code> sets the <code>
  count</code> variable of each newly created instance to zero.

<p><blockquote><pre>
proc tixArrowButton:InitWidgetRec {w} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    set data(count) 0
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>  Earlier, we showed how each widget you create is associated with an
  array of the same name.  Within the methods, you always refer to
  this array through the name <code> data</code> --the method then works
  properly in each instance of the widget.

<p><H4><A NAME=6.4.1.1> Chaining Methods</H4>

<p>  The above implementation is not sufficient because our
  TixArrowButton class is derived from TixPrimitive. The class
  derivation in Tix is basically an <i> is-a</i> relationship:
  TixArrowButton <i> is a</i> TixPrimitive. TixPrimitive defines the
  method <code> tixPrimitive:InitWidgetRec</code> which sets up the instance
  variables of every instance of TixPrimitive. Since an instance of
  TixArrowButton is also an instance of TixPrimitive, we need to make
  sure that the instance variables defined by TixPrimitive are also
  properly initialized. The technique of calling a method defined in a
  superclass is called the <i> chaining</i> of a method. The following
  implementation does this correctly:

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
proc tixArrowButton:InitWidgetRec {w} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    tixPrimitive:InitWidgetRec $w
    set data(count) 0
}
</pre></blockquote>
  Notice that <code> tixPrimitive:InitWidgetRec</code> is called before anything
  else is done. This way, we can define new classes by means of
  successive refinement: we can first ask the superclass to set up the
  instance variables, then we can modify some of those variables when
  necessary and also define new variables.

<p><H4><A NAME=6.4.1.2> The tixChainMethod call</H4>

<p>  The above implementation of <code> tixArrowButton:InitWidgetRec</code> is
  correct but it may be cumbersome if we want to switch
  superclasses. For example, suppose we want to create a new base class
  TixArrowWidget, which presumably defines common attributes of any
  class that have arrows in them. Then, instead of deriving
  TixArrowButton directly from TixPrimitive, we decide to derive
  TixArrowButton from TixArrowWidget, which is in turn derived from
  TixPrimitive:

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixWidgetClass tixArrowWidget {
    -superclass tixPrimitive
    ...
}
tixWidgetClass tixArrowButton {
    -superclass tixArrowWidget
    ...
}
</pre></blockquote>
  Now we would need to change all the method chaining calls in
  TixArrowButton from:

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixPrimitive:SomeMethod
</pre></blockquote>
  to:

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixArrowWidget:SomeMethod
</pre></blockquote>
  This may be a lot of work because you may have chained methods in many
  places in the original implementation of TixArrowButton.

<p>  The <code> tixChainMethod</code> command solves this problem. It will
  automatically find a superclass that defines the method we want to
  chain and calls this method for us. For example, the following is a
  better implementation of <code> tixArrowButton:InitWidgetRec</code> that
  uses <code> tixChainMethod</code> to avoid calling <code>
  tixPrimitive:InitWidgetRec</code> directly:

<p><blockquote><pre>
proc tixArrowButton:InitWidgetRec {w} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    tixChainMethod $w InitWidgetRec
    set data(count) 0
}
</pre></blockquote>
  Notice the order of the arguments for tixChainMethod: the name of
  the instance, <code> $w</code>, is passed before the method we want to
  chain, <code> InitWidgetRec</code>. In general, if the method we want to
  chain has $1+n$ arguments:

<p><blockquote><pre>
proc tixPrimitive:MethodToChain {w arg1 arg2 ... argn} {
    ...
}
</pre></blockquote>
  We call it with the arguments in the following order

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixChainMethod $w MethodToChain $arg1 $arg2 ... $argn
</pre></blockquote>
  We'll come back to more detailed discussion of <code> tixChainMethod</code>
  shortly. For the time being, let's take it for granted that <code>
  tixChainMethod</code> must be used in the three standard initialization
  methods: <code> InitWidgetRec</code>, <code> ConstructWidget</code> and <code>
  SetBindings</code>

<p><H3><A NAME=6.4.2>6.4.2 The ConstructWidget Method</H3>

<p>  The <code> ConstructWidget</code> method is used to creates the components
  of a widget instance. In the case of TixArrowButton, we want to
  create a new button subwidget, whose name is <code> button</code>, and use a
  bitmap to display an arrow on this button. Assuming the bitmap files
  are stored in the files <code> up.xbm</code>, <code> down.xbm</code>, <code> left.xbm</code>
  and <code> right.xbm</code>, the string substitution <code>
  @$data(-direction).xbm</code> will give us the appropriate bitmap
  depending on the current direction option of the widget instance.

<p><blockquote><pre>
proc tixArrowButton:ConstructWidget {w} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    tixChainMethod $w ConstructWidget

<p>    set data(w:button) [button $w.button -bitmap @$data(-direction).xbm]
    pack $data(w:button) -expand yes -fill both
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>  The <code> tixArrowButton:ConstructWidget</code> method shown above sets
  the variable <code> data(w:button)</code> to be the pathname of the <code>
  button</code> subwidget. As a convention of the Tix Intrinsics, we must
  declare a public subwidget <i> swid</i> by storing its pathname in the
  variable <code> data(w:</code><i> swid</i><code> )</code>.

<p><H3><A NAME=6.4.3>6.4.3 The SetBindings Method</H3>

<p>  In your interface, you want to handle a lot of events in the
  subwidgets that make up your mega-widget.  For instance, when
  somebody presses the button in a TixArrowButton widget, you want the
  button to handle the event. The <code> SetBindings</code> method is used to
  creates event bindings for the components inside the mega-widget. In
  our TixArrowButton example, we use the bind command to specify that
  the method <code> tixArrowButton:IncrCount</code> should be called each
  time when the user presses the first mouse button. As a result, we
  can count the number of times the user has pressed on the button
  (obviously for no better reasons than using it as a dumb example).

<p><blockquote><pre>
proc tixArrowButton:SetBindings {w} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    tixChainMethod $w SetBindings

<p>    bind $data(w:button) &lt;1&gt; "tixArrowButton:IncrCount $w"
}

<p>proc tixArrowButton:IncrCount {w} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    incr data(count)
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p><H2><A NAME=6.5>6.5 Declaring and Using Variables</H2>

<p>  The private variables of a widget class do not need to be
  declared. In fact they can be initialized and used anywhere by any
  method. Usually, however, general purpose private variables are
  initialized by the <code> InitWidgetRec</code> method and subwidget
  variables are initialized in the <code> ConstructWidget</code> method.

<p>  We have seen in the <code> tixArrowButton:InitWidgetRec</code> example that
  the private variable <code> data(count)</code> was initialized there. Also,
  the private variable <code> data(w:button)</code> was initialized in <code>
  tixArrowButton:ConstructWidget</code> and subsequently used in <code>
  tixArrowButton:SetBindings</code>.

<p>  In contrast, public variables must be declared inside the class
  declaration. The following arguments are used to declare the public
  variables and specify various options for them:

<p><blockquote><ul>

<p>  <li> <code> -flag</code>: As shown in the class declaration in figure
  <a href=oop.tex.html#6-2>6-2 </a>, the <code> -flag</code> argument declares all the public
  variables of the TixArrowButton class, <code> -direction</code> and <code>
  -state</code>

<p>  <li> <code> -configspec</code>: We can use the <code> -configspec</code> argument to
  specify the details of each public variable. For example, the
  following declaration

<p><blockquote><pre>
-configspec {
    {-direction direction Direction e}
    {-state state State normal}
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>  <!ignored:nind> specifies that the <code> -direction</code> variable has the resource
  name <code> direction</code> and resource class <code> Direction</code>; its default
  value is <code> e</code>. The application programmer can assign value to
  this variable by using the <code> -direction</code> option in the command
  line or by specifying resources in the Tk option database with its
  resource name or class. The declaration of <code> -state</code> installs
  similar definitions for that variable.

<p>  <li> <code> -alias</code>: The <code> -alias</code> argument is used to specify
  alternative names for public variables. In our example, the setting

<p><blockquote><pre>
-alias {
    {-dir -direction}
}
</pre></blockquote>
  specifies that <code> -dir</code> is the same variable as <code>
  -direction</code>. Therefore, when the application issue the command

<p><blockquote><pre>
.up config -dir w
</pre></blockquote>
 it is the same as issuing

<p><blockquote><pre>
.up config -direction w
</pre></blockquote>
  The <code> -alias</code> option provides only an alternative name for
  the application programmer. Inside the widget's implementation code,
  the variable is still accessed as <code> data(-direction)</code>, <i> not</i>
  <code> data(-dir)</code>.  

<p></blockquote></ul>

<p><H3><A NAME=6.5.1>6.5.1 Initialization of Public Variables</H3>

<p>  When a widget instance is created, all of its public variables are
  initialized by the Tix Intrinsics before the <code> InitWidgetRec</code>
  method is called. Therefore, <code> InitWidgetRec</code> and any other
  method of this widgte instance are free to assume that all the
  public variables have been properly initialized and use them as
  such.

<p>  The public variables are initialized by the following criteria.

<p><blockquote><ul>

<p>  <li>  Step 1: If the value of the variable is specified by the
  creation command, this value is used. For example, if the
  application programmer has created an instance in the following way:

<p><blockquote><pre>
tixArrowButton .arr -direction n
</pre></blockquote>
  The value <code> n</code> will be used for the -direction variable.

<p>  <li>  Step 2: if step 1 fails but the value of the variable is
  specified in the options database, that value is used. For example,
  if the user has created an instance in the following way:

<p><blockquote><pre>
option add *TixArrowButton.direction w
tixArrowButton .arr
</pre></blockquote>
  The value <code> w</code> will be used for the <code> -direction</code> variable.

<p>  <li>  Step3: if step 2 also fails, the default value specified in
  the <code> -configspec</code> secton of the class declaration will be used.

<p></blockquote></ul>

<p><H4><A NAME=6.5.1.1> Type Checker</H4>

<p>  You can use a <i> type ckecker procedure</i> to check whether the user
  has supplied a value of the correct type for a public variable. The
  type checker is specified in the <code> -configspec</code> section of the
  class declaration after the default value. The following code
  specifies the type checker procedure <code> CheckDirection</code> for the
  <code> -direction</code> variable:

<p><blockquote><pre>
    -configspec {
        {-direction direction Direction e CheckDirection}
        {-state state State normal}
    }
    ...
}

<p>proc CheckDirection {dir} {
    if {[lsearch {n s w e} $dir] != -1} {
        return $dir
    } else {
        error "wrong direction value &#92;&quot;$dir&#92;&quot;"
}
</pre></blockquote>
  Notice that no type checker has been specified for the <code> -state</code>
  variable and thus its value will not be checked.

<p>  If a type checker procedure is specified for a public variable, this
  procedure will be called once the value of a public variable is
  determined by the three steps mentioned above.

<p><H3><A NAME=6.5.2>6.5.2 Public Variable Configuration Methods</H3>

<p>  After a widget instance is created, the user can assign new values
  to the public variables using the configure method. For example, the
  following code changes the <code> -direction</code> variable of the <code>
  .arr</code> instance to <code> n</code>.

<p><blockquote><pre>
.arr configure -direction n
</pre></blockquote>

<p>  In order for configuration to work, you have to define a
  configuration method that does what the programmer expects. The
  configuration method of a public variable is invoked whenever the
  user calls the configure method to change the value of this
  variable. The name of a configuration method must be the name of the
  public variable prefixed by the creation command of the class and
  <code> :config</code>. For example, the name configuration method for the
  <code> -direction</code> variable of the TixArrowButton class is <code>
  tixArrowButton:config-direction</code>. The following code implements
  this method:

<p><blockquote><pre>
proc tixArrowButton:config-direction {w value} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    $data(w:button) config -bitmap @$value.xbm
}
</pre></blockquote>
  Notice that when <code> tixArrowButton:config-direction</code> is called,
  the <code> value</code> parameter contains the new value of the <code>
  -direction</code> variable but <code> data(-direction)</code> contains the <code>
  old</code> value. This is useful when the configuration method needs to
  check the previous value of the variable before taking in the new
  value.

<p>  If a type checker is defined for a variable, it will be called
  before the configuration method is called. Therefore, the
  configuration method can assume that the type of the <code> value</code>
  parameter is got is always correct.

<p>  Sometimes it is necessary to override the value supplied by the
  user. The following code illustrates this idea:

<p><blockquote><pre>
proc tixArrowButton:config-direction {w value} {
    upvar #0 $w data

<p>    if {$value == "n"} {
        set value s
        set data(-direction) $value
    }

<p>    $data(w:button) config -bitmap @$value.xbm
    return $data(-direction)
}
</pre></blockquote>
  Notice the above code always overrides values of <code> n</code> to <code>
  s</code>. If you need to override the value, you must do the following two
  things:

<p><blockquote><ul>

<p>  <li>  Explicitly set the instance variable inside the configuration
  method (the <code> set data(-direction) $value</code> line).

<p>  <li>  Return the modified value from the configuration method.
</blockquote></ul>
  If you do not need to override the value, you don't need to return
  anything from the configuration method. In this case, the Tix
  Intrinsics will assign the new value to the instance variable for
  you.

<p><H4><A NAME=6.5.2.1> Configuration Methods and Public Variable Initialization</H4>

<p>  For efficiency reasons, the configuration methods are not called
  during the intialization of the public variables. If you want to
  force the configuration method to be called for a particular public
  variable, you can specify it in the <code> -forcecall</code> section of the
  class declaration. In the following example, we force the
  configuration method of the <code> -direction</code> variable to be called
  during intialization:

<p><blockquote><pre>
-forcecall {
    -direction
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p><H2><A NAME=6.6>6.6 Summary of Widget Instance Initialization</H2>

<p>  The creation of a widget instance is a complex process. You must
  understand how it works in order to write your widget classes. The
  following is the steps taken by the Tix Intrinsics when a widget
  instance is created:

<p><blockquote><ul>

<p>  <li>  When the user creates an instance, the public variables are
  intilized as discussed in section <a href=oop.tex.html#6.5.1>6.5.1 </a>. Type checkers
  are always called if they are specified. Configuration methods are
  called only if they are specified in the <code> -forcecall</code> section.

<p>  <li>  The <code> InitWidgetRec</code> method is called. It should initialize 
  private variable, possibly according to the values the public
  variables.

<p>  <li>  The <code> ConstructWidget</code> method is called. It should create the
  component widgets. It should also store the names of public
  subwidgets into the subwidget variables.

<p>  <li>  The <code> SetBinding</code> method is called. It should create bindings for
  the component widgets.

<p></blockquote></ul>
  After the above steps, the creation of the instance is complete and the
  user can iterate with it using its widget command.

<p><H2><A NAME=6.7>6.7 Loading the New Classes</H2>

<p>  Usually, you can use a separate script file to store the
  implementaion of each new widget class. If you have several of those
  files, it will be a good idea to group the files into a single
  directory and create a <code> tclIndex</code> file for them so that the new
  classes can be auto-loaded.

<p>  Suppose you have put the class files into the directory <code>
  /usr/my/tix/classes</code>. You can create the <code> tclIndex</code> file using
  the <code> tools/tixindex</code> program that comes with Tix:

<p><blockquote><pre>
cd /usr/my/tix/classes
/usr/my/Tix4.0/tools/tixindex *.tcl
</pre></blockquote>

<p>  <!ignored:nind> The <code> tclIndex</code> file must be created by the <code> tixindex</code>
  program. You cannot use the standard <code> auto_mkindex</code> command
  that comes with Tcl.

<p>  Once you have created the <code> tclIndex</code> file, you can use your new
  widget classes by auto-loading. Here is a small demo program that
  uses the new TixArrowButton class:

<p><blockquote><pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/tixwish
lappend auto_path /usr/my/tix/classes

<p># Now I can use my TixArrowButton class!
#
tixArrowButton .arr -direction n
pack .arr
</pre></blockquote>
