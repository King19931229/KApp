<H1><A NAME=3>3 Tabular Listbox and Display Items</H1>

<p><H2><A NAME=3.1>3.1 tixTList -- The Tix Tabular Listbox Widget</H2>

<p>  <i> TixTList</i> is the Tabular Listbox Widget. It displays a list of
  items in a tabular format. For example the TixTList widget in figure
  <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-1>3-1 </a> displays files in a directory in rows and columns.

<p>  TixTList does all what the standard Tk listbox widget can do, i.e,
  it displays a list of items. However, TixTList is superior to the
  listbox widget is many respects. First, TixTList allows you to
  display the items in a two dimensional format. This way, you can
  display more items at a time. Usually, the user can locate the
  desired items much faster in a two dimensional list than the one
  dimensional list displayed by the Tk listbox widget.

<p>  In addition, while the Tk listbox widget can only display text
  items, the TixTList widget can display a multitude of types of
  items: text, images and widgets. Also, while you can use only one
  font and one color in a listbox widget, you can use many different
  fonts and colors in a TixTList widget. In figure <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-1>3-1 </a>, we
  use graphical images inside a tixTList widget to represent file
  objects. In figure <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-2>3-2 </a>, we display the names of all
  employees of a hypothetical company. Notice the use of a bold font
  to highlight all employees whose first name is Joe.

<p><H2><A NAME=3.2>3.2 Display Items</H2>

<p>  Before we rush to discuss how to create the items inside a TixTList
  widget, let's first spend some time on a very important topic about
  the Tix library: the repationship between the display items and
  their host widgets.

<p>  We can better define the terms by taking a quick preview of the
  TixHList widget, which will be covered in details in the next
  chapter. Let's compare the items displayed on the two widgets in
  figure <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-3>3-3 </a>. If we take a close look at the item
  that shows the <code> usr</code> directory in the TixTList widget on the left
  versus the TixHList widget on the right, we can see that this item
  appears exactly the same on both widgets.

<p>  If fact, all the items in these two widgets are of the <i> same</i>
  type: they all display an image next to a textual name. The only
  difference between these two widgets is how these items are
  arranged. The TixTList widget arranges the items in rows and
  columns, while the TixHList widget arranges the items in a
  hierachical format.

<p>  With this observation in mind, we can see a separation of tasks
  berween the widgets and the items they display. We call the TixHList
  and TixTList widgets in figure <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-3>3-3 </a> <i> host
  widgets</i>: their task is to arrange the items according to their
  particular rules. However, they don't really care what these items
  display; they just treat the items as rectangle boxes. In contrast,
  these items, which are called <i> display items</i> in Tix
  terminology, controls the visual information they display, such as
  the images, text strings, colors, fonts, etc. However, they don't
  really care where on the host widget they will appear.

  TixHList(right)</center></h3>

</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=3.2.1>3.2.1 Advantages of Display Items</H3>

<p>  It is easy to see the advantages of seperating the display items
  from their host widgets. First, the display items are easy to
  learn. Since they are the same across different types of
  widgets. Once you learn about a type of display items, you will know
  how to use them in all Tix widgets that support display items
  (currently these include TixHList, TixTList and the spreadsheet
  widget TixGrid, but the number is growing). In contrast, if you want
  to create a text item for the Tk widgets, you will find out that the
  listbox, text, canvas and entry widget each have a different method
  of creating and manipulating text items, and it is quite annoying to
  learn each of them individually.

<p>  Second, the hosts widgets that use display items are extensible.
  Because of the separation of task, the host widgets are not involved
  in the implementation details of the display items. Therefore, if
  you add a new type of display items, such as a <code> animation</code> type
  that displays live video, the host widgets will gladly take them in
  and display them. You don't need to modify the existing host widgets
  at all. In contrast, if you want to display graphical images in the
  existing Tk listbox widgets, you'd better set aside 100 hours to
  rewrite it completely!

<p>  Third, display items are good for writers of host widgets. Because
  now they just need to implement the arrangement policy of the host
  widgets. They don't need to worry about drawing at all because it is
  all handled by the display items. This is a significant saving in
  code because a widget that does not use display items has to spend
  30% of its C code to do the drawing.

<p><H3><A NAME=3.2.2>3.2.2 Display Items and Display Styles</H3>

<p>  The appearance of a display item is controlled by a set of
  attributes. For example, the <code> text</code> attribute controls the text
  string displayed on the item and the <code> font</code> attribute specifies
  what font should be used.

<p>  Usually, each of the attributes falls into one of two categroies:
  ``<i> individual</i>'' or ``<i> collective</i>''. For example, each of
  the items inside a TixTList widget may display a different text
  string; therefore we call the text string an <i> individual
  attribute</i>. However, in most cases, the items share the same color,
  font and spacing and we call these <i> collective attributes</i>.

<p>  One question concerns where we keep the collective attribute for the
  display items. Certainly, we can keep a <code> font</code> attribute for
  each item, but this is not really an efficient solution. In fact, if
  all the items have the same font, we would be keeping a duplicated
  copy of the same font for each of the items we create. Since a host
  widget may have many thousands of items, keeping thousands of
  dupilcated copys of the same font, or any other collective
  attributes, would be very wasteful.

<hr><center><h3>(Figure 3-4) Relationship Between Display Items and Display Styles</center></h3>

</blockquote>

<p>
  
  To advoid the unnecessary duplication of resources, Tix stores the
  collective attributes in special objects called <i> display
  styles</i>. The relationship between display items and their styles is
  depicted in figure <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-4>3-4 </a>. Each item holds its own
  copy of the individual attributes, such as <code> text</code>. However, the
  collective attributes are stored in the style objects. Each item has
  a special <code> style</code> attribute that tells it which style it should
  use. In figure <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-4>3-4 </a>, since items <i> a</i> and <i> b</i>
  are assigned the same style, therefore, they share the same font and
  color. Item <i> c</i> is assigned a different style, thus, it uses a
  different font than <i> a</i> and <i> b</i>.

<p><H2><A NAME=3.3>3.3 Creating Display Items in the TixTList Widget</H2>

<p>
<H3><A NAME=3.3.1>3.3.1 Creating Display Items</H3>

<p>  Now it's time to put our knowledge about host widgets, display items
  and display styles into practice. The following example code creates
  two items in a TixTList widget using the <code> insert</code> method:

<p><!ignored:setlength>{0.0cm}
<blockquote><pre>
tixTList .t
pack .t

<p>.t insert end -itemtype text -text "First Item"  -underline 0
.t insert end -itemtype text -text "Second Item" -underline 0

<p>set picture [image create bitmap -file picture.xbm]
.t insert end -itemtype image -image $picture
</pre></blockquote>
<!ignored:setlength>{0.2cm}

<p>  <!ignored:nind> As we can see, the <code> insert</code> method of TixTList is very
  similar to the <code> insert</code> method of the standard Tk listbox
  widget: it inserts a new item into the TixTList widget.  The first
  argument it takes is the location of the new item. For example <code>
  0</code> indicates the first location in the list, <code> 1</code> indicates the
  second location, and so on. Also the special keyword <code> end</code>
  indicates the end of the list.

<p>  Then, we can use the <code> -itemtype</code> switch to specify the type of
  display item we want to create. There are currently four types of
  items to choose from: <code> text</code>, <code> image</code>, <code> imagetext</code> and
  <code> window</code>. In the above example, we create two items of the type
  <code> text</code> and one item of the type <code> image</code>. The subsequent
  arguments to the <code> insert</code> method set the configuration options
  of the individual attributes of the new item. The available
  options for these items are listed in figures ???
  through ???.

<p><H3><A NAME=3.3.2>3.3.2 Setting the Styles of the Display Items</H3>

<p>  Note that in the above example, if we want to control the foreground
  color of the text items, we cannot issue commands such as:

<p><blockquote><pre>
.t insert end -itemtype text -text "First Item" -foreground black
</pre></blockquote>
  because <code> -foreground</code> is not an individual attribute of the text
  item. Instead, it is a collective attribute and must be accessed
  using a display style object. To do that we can use the command <code>
  tixItemStyle</code> to create display styles, as shown in the following
  example:

<p><blockquote><pre>
set style1 [tixDisplayStyle text -font 8x13]
set style2 [tixDisplayStyle text -font 8x13bold]

<p>tixTList .t; pack .t

<p>.t insert end -itemtype text -text "First Item"  -underline 0 <br>    -style $style1
.t insert end -itemtype text -text "Second Item" -underline 0  <br>    -style $style2
.t insert end -itemtype text -text "Third Item"  -underline 0  <br>    -style $style1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  <!ignored:nind> The first argument of <code> tixDisplayStyle</code> specify the type
  of style we want to create. Each type of display item needs its own
  type of display styles. Therefore, for example, we cannot create a
  style of type <code> text</code> and assign it to an item of type <code>
  image</code>. The subsequent arguments to <code> tixDisplayStyle</code> set the
  configuration options of the collective attributes defined by this
  style. A complete list of the configuration options of each type of
  the display style is in figures ??? through
  ???.

<p>  The <code> tixDisplayStyle</code> command returns the names of the newly
  created styles to us and we use the variables <code> style1</code> and <code>
  style2</code> to store these names. We can then assign the styles to the
  display items by using the names of the styles. As shown in figure
  <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-5>3-5 </a>, by assing these two styles to the <code>
  -style</code> option of the display items, we assigned a medium-weight
  font to the first and third item and a bold font to the second item.

<p><blockquote><a name=3-5>

<center><TABLE BORDER=0><TR> 
<p> <td valign=bottom>
     <img src=fig/tlist/twofont.gif>
    <p><h4><center>Three <code> text</code> items in a TixTList</center></h4></td>
<p> <td valign=bottom>
     <img src=fig/tlist/twofont2.gif>
    <p><h4><center>The <code> text</code> items with fonts switched</center></h4></td>
 </TR></TABLE></center>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 3-5) Two Display Styles With Different Fonts</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>  The name of the style returned by <code> tixDisplayStyle</code> is also the
  name of a command which we can use to control the style. For
  example, we can use the following commands to switch the fonts in
  the two styles we created in the above example:

<p><blockquote><pre>
$style1 configure -font 8x13bold
$style2 configure -font 8x13
</pre></blockquote>
  After the execution of the above command, the font in the second
  item in the TixTList widget becomes medium-weight and the font in
  the first and third items becomes bold, as shown in figure
  <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-5>3-5 </a>.

<p><H3><A NAME=3.3.3>3.3.3 Configuring and Deleting the Items</H3>

<p>  You can configure the individual attributes of the items using the
  <code> entryconfigure</code> method. There is also the entrycget method for
  querying the attributes of the items. To <code> delete</code> the items, you
  can use the delete method. In the following example, we use these
  two methods to change the first and third items to display the text
  strings <code> One</code> and <code> Two</code> and change the third item to use the
  style <code> $style2</code>. Then we delete the second item using the <code>
  delete</code> command.
  
<blockquote><pre>
.t entryconfigure 0 -text One
.t entryconfigure 2 -text Two
.t delete 1
</pre></blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=3.3.4>3.3.4 Choosing the Orientation and Number of Rows or Columns</H3>

<p>  There are three options that controls the layout of the items in the
  TixTList widget. The <code> -orientation</code> option can be set to either
  vertical or horizontal. When <code> -orientation</code> is set to <code>
  vertical</code>, the items are laid out vertically from top down and
  wrapped to the next column when the bottom is reached (see figure
  <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-6>3-6 </a>). The opposite layout policy is chosen if
  <code> -orientation</code> is set to <code> horizontal</code> (see figure
  <a href=tlist.tex.html#3-6>3-6 </a>).

<p>  When the <code> -orientation</code> option is set to <code> vertical</code>,
  normally the number of columns displayed depends on the number of
  items in the TixTList widget: the more items there are, the more
  columns will there be. However, we can use the <code> -columns</code> option
  to control the number of columns: the items will be wrapped in a way
  so that the number of columns produced will be exactly as dicated by
  the <code> -columns</code> option.

<p>  One use of the <code> -columns</code> option is to specify the same layout
  policy as that of the standard Tk listbox widget. We can do this by
  setting <code> -orientation</code> to vertical and <code> -columns</code> to <code>
  1</code>. This way we can get a replacement listbox widget that can
  display multiple fonts and colors and graphics!

<p>  The counterpart of the <code> -columns</code> option is the <code> -rows</code>
  option, which is used for the same purpose when the <code>
  -orientation</code> option is set to <code> horizontal</code>.

</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=3.3.5>3.3.5 Event Handling</H3>

<p>  You can handle the events in a TList widget using the <code>
  -browsecmd</code> and <code> -command</code> options. The meanings of these two
  options are silimar to their meanings in other Tix widgets such as
  the ComboBox. Usually, the command specified by <code> -browsecmd</code> is
  called when the user clicks or drags the mouse over the items or
  presses the arrow keys. The command specified by <code> -command</code> is
  called when the user double-clicks or presses the Return key.  These
  commands are called with one extra argument --- the index of the
  currently ``active'' item, which is usually the item under the mouse
  cursor.

<p><H3><A NAME=3.3.6>3.3.6 Selection</H3>

<p>  The <code> -selectmode</code> option controls how many items the user can
  select at one time. In the <code> single</code> and <code> browse</code> mode, the
  user can select only one item at a time. In the <code> multiple</code> and
  <code> extended</code> mode, the user can select multiple items; the <code>
  extended</code> mode allows disjoint selections while the <code> multiple</code>
  mode does not.

<p>  Normally, the user selects the items using the mouse or the
  keyboard. You can find out which items the user has selected with
  the <code> info selection</code> method, which returns a list of the
  currently selected items. You can also set the selection using the
  <code> selection set</code> method. For example, the command <code> .tlist
  selection set 3</code> selects the item whose index is <code> 3</code>. The
  command <code> .tlist selection set 2 10</code> selects all the items at
  index <code> 2</code> through <code> 10</code>. The method <code> selection clear</code>
  empties the selection.
