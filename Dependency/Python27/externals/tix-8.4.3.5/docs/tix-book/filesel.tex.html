<p><H1><A NAME=5>5 Selecting Files and Directories</H1>

<p>  One task that an application has to perform frequently is to ask the
  user to select files or directories. To select files, you can use
  the Tix <i> File Selection Widgets</i>: TixFileSelectDialog and
  TixExFileSelectDialog. To select directories, you can use the Tix
  <i> Directory Selection Widgets</i>: TixDirList and TixDirTree.

<p><H2><A NAME=5.1>5.1 File Selection Dialog Widgets</H2>

<p>  There are two file dialog widgets inside Tix: the
  TixFileSelectDialog (figure <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-2>5-2 </a>) is similar to the
  FileSelectionDialog widget in Motif; TixExFileSelectDialog (figure
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-3>5-3 </a>) looks like its conunterpart in MS Windows. Both
  widgets let the user navigate through the file system directories
  and select a file.

<p>  One advanced feature of both types of file selection boxes is they
  use ComboBoxes to store the files, directories and patterns the user
  has selected in the past. If the user wants to select the same files
  again, he can simply open the ComboBoxes and click on his past
  inputs. This saves a lot of keystrokes and is especially useful when
  the user needs to switch among several files or directories.

<p>
<H3><A NAME=5.1.1>5.1.1 Using the TixFileSelectDialog Widget</H3>

<p>  An example of using the TixFileSelectDialog widget is in figure
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-1>5-1 </a>. At line 1, we create a TixFileSelectDialog
  widget and set the title of the dialog to ``Select A File'' using
  the <code> -title</code> option. We also use the <code> -command</code> option to
  specify that the procedure <code> selectCmd</code> should be called when the
  user has selected a file. <code> selectCmd</code> will be called with one
  parameter, the filename selected by the user. When the
  TixFileSelectDialog widget is created, it is initially not shown on
  the screen. Therefore, at line 3, we call its <code> popup</code> widget
  command to place the widget on the screen.

<p><blockquote><a name=5-1>
<pre>
tixFileSelectDialog .file -title "Select A File" -command selectCmd
.file subwidget fsbox config -pattern "*.txt" -directory /usr/info
.file popup

<p>proc selectCmd {filename} {
    puts "You have selected $filename"
}
</pre>

</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=5.1.2>5.1.2 The Subwidget in the TixFileSelectDialog</H3>

<p>  We may also want to set other options for the file dialog such as
  its file filter and working directory. To do this, we must know the
  composition of the TixFileSelectDialog widget. As shown in figure
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-2>5-2 </a>, the TixFileSelectDialog contains a subwidget <code>
  fsbox</code> of the type TixFileSelectBox and a subwidget <code> bbox</code> of
  the type TixStdButtonBox.

<p>  The <code> fsbox</code> subwidget supports the <code> -pattern</code> and <code>
  -directory</code> options. At line 2 of figure <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-1>5-1 </a>, we
  use the <code> -directory</code> option to tell the <code> fsbox</code> subwidget to
  display files in the directory <code> /usr/info</code>; we also use the <code>
  -pattern</code> option to specify we only want the filenames that has the
  <code> txt</code> extension.

<p>  The <code> fsbox</code> subwidget also supports the <code> -selection</code> option,
  which stores the filename currently selected by the user. We can
  query this value by the <code> cget</code> widget command of the <code> fsbox</code>
  subwidget.

<p>  Remember that the <code> -pattern</code>, <code> -directory</code> and <code>
  -selection</code> options do not belong to the TixFileSelectDialog
  widget. A common mistake that people make is to try to configure the
  non-existent <code> -pattern</code> option of the TixFileSelectDialog, which
  causes much despair, long error messages and great loss of
  self-confidence. <i> Always remember:</i>, when you want to configure
  an option, find out whether it belongs to the widget or its
  subwidgets.

</blockquote>

<p>
  The TixExFileSelectDialog widget is very similar to the
  TixFileSelectDialog widget. It supports all the options and widget
  commands of the latter, so essentially we can just take the program
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-1>5-1 </a> and replace the command <code> tixFileSelectDialog</code>
  in the first line to <code> tixExFileSelectDialog</code>.

<p>  The composition of the TixExFileSelectDialog widget is a bit
  different: it contains one contains one subwidget, which is also
  called <code> fsbox</code>, of the type TixExFileSelectBox widget (figure
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-3>5-3 </a>). Again this <code> fsbox</code> widgets supports all
  widget options and commands of the <code> fsbox</code> subwidget in
  TixFileSelectDialog, so the line 2 of program <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-1>5-1 </a>
  can work for TixExFileSelectDialog widgets without any change.

<p><H3><A NAME=5.1.4>5.1.4 Specifying File Types for TixExFileSelectDialog</H3>

<p>  The TixExFileSelectBox widget has a ComboBox subwidget marked as
  ``Select Files of Type:'' (see figure <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-3>5-3 </a>). This widget
  contains some pre-set types of files for the user to choose
  from. For example, a word processor program can include choices such
  as ``Microsoft Word Documents'' and ``WordPerfect Documents''.

<p>  The TixExFileSelectBox widget has a <code> -filetypes</code> option for this
  purpose. As shown in line 3 through 7 in program
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-4>5-4 </a>, the value for the <code> -filetypes</code> option is
  a list. Each item in the list should contain two parts. The first
  part is a list of file patterns and the second part is the textual
  name for this type of files.

<p><H3><A NAME=5.1.5>5.1.5 The <b> <code> tix filedialog</code></b> Command</H3>

<p>  TixExFileSelectDialog and TixFileSelectDialog are very similar to
  each other. So which one should we use? That is just a matter of
  taste. However, since we know that programmers usually have bad
  taste, clever programmers would rather step aside and let the users
  exercise their own taste. To do this, we can use the <code> tix
  filedialog</code> command.

<p>  For any programs based on Tix, the user can choose his preferred
  type of file dialog by setting the X resource <code> FileDialog</code> to
  either <code> tixFileSelectDialog</code> or <code> tixExFileSelectDialog</code>.
  This can usually be done by inserting a line similar to the
  following into the user's <code> .Xdefaults</code> file:

<p><blockquote><pre>
*myapp*FileDialog: tixExFileSelectDialog
</pre></blockquote>
  When we call the command <code> tix filedialog</code>, it will return a file
  dialog widget of the user's preferred type.

<p>  The advantage of using <code> tix filedialog</code> is it makes coding
  flexible. If the management suddenly mandates that we dump the Motif
  look-and-feel in favor of the MS Windows look-and-feel, we don't
  need to dig up every line of <code> tixFileSelectDialog</code> calls and
  replace it with <code> tixExFileSelectDialog</code>. Also, <code> tix
  filedialog</code> creates only one copy of the file dialog, which can be
  shared by different parts of the program. Therefore, we can avoid
  creating a separate file dialog widget for each of the ``Open'',
  ``Save'' and ``Save As'' commands in our application. This way, we
  can save resource since a file dialog is a large widget and it takes
  up quite a bit of space.

<p><blockquote><a name=5-4>
<blockquote><pre>
set dialog [tix filedialog]
$dialog -title "Select A File" -command selectCmd
$dialog subwidget fsbox config -pattern "*.txt" -directory /usr/info
if {[winfo class $dialog] == "TixExFileSelectDialog"} {
    $dialog subwidget fsbox config -filetypes {
        {{*}            {*     -- All files}}
        {{*.txt}        {*.txt -- Text files}}
        {{*.c}          {*.c   -- C source files}}
    }

}

<hr><center><h3>(Figure 5-4) Using the <code> tix dialog</code> command</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>  The use of the <code> tix filedialog</code> command is shown in program
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-4>5-4 </a>. This program is very similar to what we saw
  in program <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-1>5-1 </a>, except now we aren't really sure
  which type of file dialog the user have chosen. Therefore, if we
  want to do something allowed for only one type of file dialogs, we
  have to be careful. At line 4 of program <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-4>5-4 </a>, we
  use the <code> winfo</code> command to see whether the type of the file
  dialog is TixExFileSelectDialog. If so, we set the value for the
  <code> -filetypes</code> option of its <code> fsbox</code> subwidget.

<p>
<H2><A NAME=5.2>5.2 Selecting Directories with the TixDirTree and TixDirList Widgets</H2>

<p>  There are two Tix widgets for selecting a directory: TixDirList
  (figure <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-6>5-6 </a>) and TixDirTree (figure
  <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-6>5-6 </a>). Both of them display the directories in a
  hierarchical format. The display in the TixDirList widget is more
  compact: it shows only the parent- and child-directories of a
  particular directory. The TixDirTree widget, on the other hand, can
  display the whole tree structure of the file system.

<p>  The programming interface of these two widgets are the same and you
  can choose the which one to use depending on your application. As
  shown in the following example, you can use the <code> -directory</code>
  option of the TixDirList widget to specify a directory to
  display. In the example, we set <code> -directory</code> to be <code>
  /home/ioi/dev</code>. As a result, the TixDirList widget displays all the
  subdirectories and all the ancestor directories of <code>
  /home/ioi/dev</code>. You can use the <code> -command</code> and <code> -browsecmd</code>
  options to handle the user events: a double click or Return
  key-stroke will trigger the <code> -command</code> option and a single click
  or space bar key stroke will trigger the <code> -browsecmd</code>
  option. Normally, you would handle both type of events in the same
  manner, as we have done in program <a href=filesel.tex.html#5-5>5-5 </a>

<p><blockquote><a name=5-5>
<blockquote><pre>
tixDirList .d -value /home/ioi/dev <br>    -command "selectDir" -browsecmd "selectDir"
pack .d

<p>proc selectDir {dir} {
    puts "now you select $dir"
}
</pre></blockquote>
