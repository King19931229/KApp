<H1><A NAME=2>2 Container Widgets</H1>

<p>  In addition to providing some nice-looking interface elements, Tix
  offers some useful ways to organize the elements that you create.
  It does this by providing <i> container widgets</i>, which are widgets
  designed to contain whatever you want to put into them.

<p>  Different container widgets have different policies as to how they
  arrange the widgets inside them. In this chapter, we'll talk about
  TixNoteBook, which arranges its subwidgets using a notebook
  metaphor, TixPanedWindow, which arranges its subwidgets in
  non-overlapping horizontal or vertical panes, and a family of
  ``Scrolled Widgets'', which attach scrollbars to their subwidgets.

<p><H2><A NAME=2.1>2.1 TixNoteBook</H2>

<p>  When your need to put a lot of information into your interface, you
  may find out that your window has to grow intolerably big in order
  to hold all the information. Having a window that's 10000
  pixels wide and 5000 pixels high doesn't seem to be the perfect
  solution. Of course, you can ``chop up'' your big window into a set
  of smaller dialog boxes, but the user will most likely find it
  impossible to manage 20 different dialog boxes on their desktop.

<p>  The TixNoteBook (fig <a href=container.tex.html#2-1>2-1 </a>) widget comes into
  rescue. It allows you to pack a large interface into manageable
  ``pages'' using a notebook metaphor: it contains multiple pages with
  anything you want on them, displays one at a time, and attaches a
  tab to each page so the user can bring it forward with a single
  click on the tab.

<p><blockquote><a name=2-1>

</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=2.1.1>2.1.1 Adding Pages to a TixNoteBook</H3>

<p>  The example program in figure <a href=container.tex.html#2-2>2-2 </a> creates the
  TixNoteBook widget shown in figure <a href=container.tex.html#2-1>2-1 </a>. In the first
  three lines, we create the notebook widget and two pages inside
  it. While we create the pages, we also set the labels on the tabs
  associated with each page and use the <code> -underline</code> option to
  indicate the keyboard accelerator for each page.

<p>  Each time we create a page in the notebook using the <code> add</code>
  method, a frame subwidget is created for us automatically. This
  frame subwidget has the same name as the page (the first parameter
  passed to the <code> add</code> method). We can use the <code> subwidget</code>
  method to find out the pathname of this frame subwidget and pack
  everything we want to display on the page into this frame
  widget. Lines 4-10 of program <a href=container.tex.html#2-2>2-2 </a> shows how to create
  the widgets inside the ``Hard Disk'' page. Creating the widgets
  inside the ``Network'' page will be similar.

<p><blockquote><a name=2-2>
<blockquote><pre>
tixNoteBook .n
.n add hd  -label "Hard Disk" -underline 0
.n add net -label "Network"   -underline 0

<p>set frame [.n subwidget hd]
tixControl $frame.access   -label "Access Time:"
tixControl $frame.write    -label "Write Throughput:"
tixControl $frame.read     -label "Read Througput:"
tixControl $frame.capacity -label "Capacity:"
pack $frame.access $frame.write $frame.read $frame.capacity <br>    -side top -fill x
</pre></blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=2.1.2>2.1.2 Keyboard Accelerators</H3>

<p>  Note that in line 2-3 of program <a href=container.tex.html#2-2>2-2 </a>, we have indicated
  the keyboard accelerators for the two pages using the <code>
  -underline</code> option. The value of this option is the position of the
  character to be underlined in the string, where zero represents the
  first character. When the user presses <code> &lt;Alt-N&gt;</code> or <code>
  &lt;Meta-N&gt;</code> the ``Network'' page will be activated; on the other hand,
  if he presses <code> &lt;Alt-H&gt;</code> or <code> &lt;Meta-H&gt;</code> the ``Hard Disk'' page
  will be activated. The TixNoteBook widget will automatically create
  the keyboard bindings for these accelerators for us, in a way
  similar to what the menu widget does, so there is no need to set the
  keyboard bindings ourself.

<p><H3><A NAME=2.1.3>2.1.3 Delaying the Creation of New Pages</H3>

<p>  If your notebook contains many complicated pages, it may take quite a
  while to create all widgets inside these pages and your program will
  probably freezes for a few seconds when it pops up the notebook for
  the first time. To avoid embarrassing moments like this, we can use
  the ``delayed page creation'' feature of the TixNoteBook widget.

<p>  When we create a page using the <code> add</code> method, we can specify
  the optional parameter <code> -createcmd</code> so that we only need to
  create the page when the user wants to see it. This is illustrated
  in program <a href=container.tex.html#2-3>2-3 </a>:

<p><blockquote><a name=2-3>
<blockquote><pre>
tixNoteBook .n
.n add hd  -label "Hard Disk" -underline 0 -createcmd CreateHd
.n add net -label "Network"   -underline 0 -createCmd CreateNet

<p>proc CreateHd {frame} {
    tixControl $frame.access   -label "Access Time:"
    tixControl $frame.write    -label "Write Throughput:"
    tixControl $frame.read     -label "Read Througput:"
    tixControl $frame.capacity -label "Capacity:"
    pack $frame.access $frame.write $frame.read $frame.capacity <br>        -side top -fill x
}

<p>proc CreateNet {frame} {
    ...
}
</pre></blockquote>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 2-3) Delayed Page Creation</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>  In line 2 of program <a href=container.tex.html#2-3>2-3 </a>, we use the <code> -createcmd</code>
  option to specify that the procedure <code> CreateHd</code> should be called
  when the ``Hard Disk'' page needs to be created. <code> CreateHd</code>
  takes one argument, the frame subwidget of the page. As we can see,
  program program <a href=container.tex.html#2-3>2-3 </a> is not very different than program
  <a href=container.tex.html#2-2>2-2 </a>, except now we can issue less commands during the
  set-up of the NoteBook widget and the interface can be started up
  more quickly.

<p><H3><A NAME=2.1.4>2.1.4 Changing Page Tabs and Deleting Pages</H3>

<p>  To change the information in the tabs of the pages, we can use the
  <code> pageconfigure</code> method. For example, the following command:

<p><blockquote><pre>
.nb pageconfigure hd -label "Fixed Disk"
</pre></blockquote>
  changes the label from ``Hard Disk'' to ``Fixed Disk''.  To delete a
  page, we can use the <code> delete</code> method.

<p>  You should avoid using the <code> pageconfigure</code> and <code>
  delete</code>. Your users will just feel annoyed if the interface changes
  all the time and notebook pages appear and disappear every now and
  then.

<p><H2><A NAME=2.2>2.2 PanedWindow</H2>

<p>  The <i> TixPanedWindow</i> widget arranges arranges its subwidgets in
  non-overlapping panes. As we can see in figure <a href=container.tex.html#2-4>2-4 </a>, the
  PanedWindow widget puts a resize handle between the panes for the
  user to manipulate the sizes of the panes interactively. The panes
  can be arranged either vertically (figure <a href=container.tex.html#2-4>2-4 </a>) or
  horizontally (<a href=container.tex.html#2-4>2-4 </a>).

<p>  Each individual pane may have upper and lower limits of its
  size. The user changes the sizes of the panes by dragging the resize
  handle between two panes.

<p><blockquote><a name=2-4>

 </TR></TABLE></center>

<hr><center><h3>(Figure 2-4) The TixPane Widget</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=2.2.1>2.2.1 Adding Panes Inside a TixPanedWindow Widget</H3>

<p>  You can create a TixPanedWindow widget using the <code> tixPanedWindow</code>
  command. After that, you can add panes into this widget using the
  <code> add</code> method (see program <a href=container.tex.html#2-5>2-5 </a>).

<p>  When you use the <code> add</code> method, there are several optional
  parameters which you can use to control the size of each of the
  pane. The <code> -min</code> parameter controls the minimum size of the pane
  and the <code> -max</code> parameter controls its maximum size. These two
  parameters controls how much the user can expand or shrink a
  pane. If neither is specified, then the pane can be expanded or
  shrunk without restrictions.

<p>  In addition, the -size parameter specifies the initial size of the
  pane. If it is not specified, then the initial size of the pane will
  be its natural size.

<p>  In program <a href=container.tex.html#2-5>2-5 </a>, we set the initial size of <code> pane1</code> to
  100 pixels using the -size parameter. We don't set the <code> -size</code>
  parameter for <code> pane2</code> so it will appear in its natural
  size. However, we use the <code> -max</code> option for <code> pane2</code> so that
  the user can never expand the size of <code> pane2</code> to more than 300
  pixels.

<p><blockquote><a name=2-5>
<blockquote><pre>
tixPanedWindow .p
.p add pane1 -size 100
.p add pane2 -max 300

<p>set p1 [.p subwidget pane1]
button $p1.b1 -text Button1
button $p1.b2 -text Button2
pack $p1.b1 $p1.b2 -side left -expand yes

<p>set p2 [.p subwidget pane2]
button $p2.b -text "Another Button"
pack $p2.b -side left -expand yes -fill both

<p>pack .p -expand yes -fill both
</pre></blockquote>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 2-5) Adding Panes into a TixPanedWindow Widget</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=2.2.2>2.2.2 Putting Widgets Inside the Panes</H3>

<p>  Each pane we have created using the <code> add</code> method is essentially
  a frame widget. After we have created the panes, we can put widgets
  inside them. As shown inside program <a href=container.tex.html#2-5>2-5 </a>, we can use the
  <code> subwidget</code> method to find out the name of the pane
  subwidgets. Then we can just create new widgets as their children
  and pack these new widgets inside the panes. The output of program
  <a href=container.tex.html#2-5>2-5 </a> is shown in figure <a href=container.tex.html#2-6>2-6 </a>

<p><blockquote><a name=2-6>
<center><img src=fig/container/pane_add.gif></center>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 2-6) Output of Program <a href=container.tex.html#2-5>2-5 </a></center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p><H3><A NAME=2.2.3>2.2.3 Setting the Order of the Panes</H3>

<p>  Usually, when you create a new pane, it is always added to the
  bottom or right of the list of panes. If you want to control the
  order in which the panes appear inside the TixPanedWindow widget,
  you can use the two optional parameters, <code> -before</code> and <code>
  -after</code>, for the <code> add</code> method.  For example, the call:

<p><blockquote><pre>
.p add pane2 -after pane1
</pre></blockquote>
  will place the new pane immediately after <code> pane1</code>. The call:
  
<blockquote><pre>
.p add pane2 -before pane1
</pre></blockquote>
   will place the new pane immediately in front of <code> pane1</code>.
 
<H3><A NAME=2.2.4>2.2.4 Changing the Sizes of the Panes</H3>

<p>  If you want to change the sizes of the existing panes or change
  their maximum/minimum size constraints, you can use the
  <code> paneconfigure</code> method. For example, the following code changes the
  size of <code> pane2</code> to 100 pixels and adjusts its minimum size
  constraint to no less than 10 pixels:

<p><blockquote><pre>
.p paneconfigure pane2 -size 100 -min 10
</pre></blockquote>
  Notice that after you call the <code> paneconfigure</code> method, the
  PanedWindow may jitter and that may annoy the user. Therefore, use
  this method only when it is necessary.

<p><H2><A NAME=2.3>2.3 The Family of Scrolled Widgets</H2>

<p>  With plain Tcl/Tk, the widgets do not automatically come with
  scrollbars. If you want to use scrollbars with the text, canvas or
  listbox widgets, you will need to create scrollbars separately and
  attach them to the widgets. This can be a lot of hassle because you
  would almost always need scrollbars for these widgets. Sometimes you
  will wonder why you need to write the same boring code again and
  again just to get the scrollbars to working.

<p>  The Tix scrolled widgets are here to make your life easier. With a
  single command such as <code> tixScrolledListBox</code> or <code>
  tixScrolledText</code>, you can create a listbox or text widget that comes
  automatically with scrollbars attached.

<p>  Another advantage of the Tix scrolled widgets is that you can
  specify their scrolling policy so that the scrollbars appear only
  when they are needed. This feature is especially useful if you are
  displaying a lot of widgets and running out of screen real estate.

<p><H3><A NAME=2.3.1>2.3.1 The Scrolled Listbox Widget</H3>

<p>  You can create a scrolled listbox widget using the <code>
  tixScrolledListBox</code> command. Notice that the widget created by the
  <code> tixScrolledListBox</code> command is not itself a listbox
  widget. Rather, it is a frame widget which contains two scrollbar
  subwidgets: one is called <code> hsb</code> (the horizontal scrollbar) and
  the other is called <code> vsb</code> (the vertical scrollbar). Similarly,
  the listbox being scrolled is also a subwidget which is
  appropriately called <code> listbox</code>. Therefore, if we need to put
  things into the listbox (as we always do!), we can use the <code>
  subwidget</code> method. As shown in program <a href=container.tex.html#2-7>2-7 </a>, we first
  find the pathname of the <code> listbox</code> subwidget by calling ``<code>
  .sl subwidget listbox</code>''. Then, we insert some items into the <code>
  listbox</code> subwidget.

<p><blockquote><a name=2-7>
<blockquote><pre>
tixScrolledListBox .sl -scrollbar auto
set listbox [.sl subwidget listbox]

<p>for {set x 0} {$x &lt; 6} {incr x} {
    $listbox insert end "This is item $x"
}

<p>pack .sl -side left -expand yes -fill both
</pre></blockquote>

 </TR></TABLE></center>

<hr><center><h3>(Figure 2-8) Scrolled ListBox with Automatic Scrollbars</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Also, as seen in the first line of program <a href=container.tex.html#2-7>2-7 </a>, we use
  the <code> -scrollbar</code> option to control the scrolling policy of the
  TixScrolledListBox widget. Usually, we'll set it to ``<code> auto</code>'':
  the scrollbars are displayed only if they are needed. Other possible
  values are ``<code> both</code>'': the two scrollbars are always displayed;
  ``<code> x</code>'': the horizontal scrollbar is always displayed, while the
  vertical scrollbar is always hidden; ``<code> y</code>'': the opposite of
  ``<code> x</code>''; ``<code> none</code>'': the two scrollbars are always
  hidden. The result of program <a href=container.tex.html#2-7>2-7 </a> is shown in figure
  <a href=container.tex.html#2-8>2-8 </a>.

<p><H3><A NAME=2.3.2>2.3.2 Other Scrolled Widgets</H3>

<p>  The <b> TixScrolledText</b> widget is very similar to the
  TixScrolledListBox widget, except it scrolls a text subwidget, which
  is called <code> text</code>. One problem with the TixScrolledText widget,
  though, is its <code> -scrollbar</code> option doesn't work in the <b>
  auto</b> mode. This is due to a bug in Tk which doesn't report the
  width of the <b> text</b> subwidget correctly. Until this bug is fixed
  in TK, the <b> auto</b> mode will behave the same way as the both mode
  for the TixScrolledText widget.

<p>  Another scrolled-widget is <b> TixScrolledWindow</b>. Sometimes you
  have a large number of widgets that can't possibly be shown in the
  screen all at once and your application doesn't allow you to divide
  the widgets into several pages of a TixNoteBook. In this case you
  can use TixScrolledWindow. It contains a frame subwidget called <code>
  window</code>. You can just create as many widgets as you need as children
  of the <code> window</code> subwidget. An example is shown in program
  <a href=container.tex.html#2-9>2-9 </a>, which uses the TixScrolledWindow widget to
  implement a ``cheap'' spreadsheet application. The boxes of the
  spreadsheet are just entry widgets and they are packed inside the
  <code> window</code> subwidget. The user will be able to scroll to different
  parts of the spreadsheet if it is too large to fit in one screen.

<p><blockquote><a name=2-9>
<blockquote><pre>
tixScrolledWindow .sw -scrollbar auto
set f [.sw subwidget window]

<p>for {set x 0} {$x &lt; 10} {incr x} {
    frame $f.f$x
    pack  $f.f$x -side top -expand yes -fill both
    for {set y 0} {$y &lt; 10} {incr y} {
        entry $f.f$x.e$y -width 10
        pack $f.f$x.e$y -side left -fill x
    }
}

<p>pack .sw -side left -expand yes -fill both
</pre></blockquote>
<hr><center><h3>(Figure 2-9) Cheap Spreadsheet Application with TixScrolledWindow</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>  There are two more scrolled-widgets in the Tix library: <b>
  TixScrolledTList</b> scrolls a TixTList widget and <b>
  TixScrolledHList</b> scrolls a TixHList widget. The subwidgets that
  they scroll are called <code> tlist</code> and <code> hlist</code>,
  respectively. The use of the TList and HList widgets will be
  described in the next chapters.
