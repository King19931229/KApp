============
BUILDING TIX
============
1. You must have a recent source distribution of Tcl/Tk installed (we
   have tested with 8.0.4 and 8.0.5).

2. For Unix, You should be able to change to unix/tk8.0; then,
   configure and compile with:
        ./configure
        make > make.log

   Before running "make", you can edit the Makefile and change the -O
   compile option to -O2 for slightly better performance with gcc/egcs.

   You may find the configure options --prefix, --with-tcl, --with-tk
   etc. useful. For example, I have a copy of the egcs compiler
   installed as /d2a/exper/bin/gcc, the tcl8.0.5 and tk8.0.5 source
   distributions at /d2a/src/tcl-tk/tcl8.0.5 and
   /d2a/src/tcl-tk/tk8.0.5 respectively, and prefer to install Tix to
   /d2a/exper, so I use something like this:

        env PATH=/d2a/exper/bin:$PATH ./configure \
            --prefix=/d2a/exper --enable-gcc --enable-shared \
            --with-tcl=/d2a/src/tcl-tk/tcl8.0.5 \
            --with-tk=/d2a/src/tcl-tk/tk8.0.5

   [If you reassign the PATH variable like this, remember to do the
   same thing with all the "make" commands as well.]

   If the compile failed for some reason, you can look at the files
   make.errs and make.log for clues.

3. If the compile is successful, you should now be able to run it:
        ./tixwish
        source ../../demos/widget
   This will bring up a demo window with lots of Tix megawidgets.

4. You can now run the test suite if you wish and install Tix:
      make tests [optional]
      make install
   [If the "make tests" fails with a complaint like this:
           ld.so: open error 2 for /libtix4180.so.1.0
    edit Makefile and remove the line that assigns a value to
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the "tests" target (I had to do this on SunOS)].

5. For WinNT, read win/README.
