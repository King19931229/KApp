============
BUILDING TIX
============
1. You must have a recent source distribution of Tcl/Tk installed (we
   have tested with and 8.0.5 and 8.2.3). Stubs are not yet supported.

2. For Unix,  Change to unix, then

sh configure

   DO NOT make yet.
   
   You may find the configure options --prefix, and 
   --with-tclconfig, --with-tkconfig useful. For help on the options, run
   	sh configure --help
   
   For example, I prefer to install Tix to
   /home/tmp, so I use something like this:

        sh ./configure \
            --prefix=/home/tmp --enable-gcc --enable-shared \
            --with-tclconfig=../../tcl8.2.3 \
            --with-tkconfig=../../tk8.2.3

    Next, choose the subdirectory that corresponds to your Tcl version,
    and change to that directory
	cd tk8.2
	
    Configure and compile with:

	./configure
	make > make.log

      or in the example above
  
         sh ./configure \
            --prefix=/home/tmp --enable-gcc --enable-shared \
            --with-tclconfig=../../../tcl8.2.3 \
            --with-tkconfig=../../../tk8.2.3


   Before running "make", you can edit the Makefile and change the -O
   compile option to -O2 for slightly better performance with gcc/egcs.

   If the compile failed for some reason, you can look at the file
   make.log for clues.

3. If the compile is successful, you should now be able to run it:

	./tixwish
	cd ../../tests
        source Driver.tcl
   This will bring up a demo window with lots of Tix megawidgets.

4. You can now run the test suite if you wish and install Tix:
      make tests [optional]
      make install
    
   Then install in the unix/ directory
   
   	cd ..
	make install
