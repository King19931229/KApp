	1) Added a starting User Manual in html and pdf.
	   Changed the programming guide from ps to pdf.

	3) Minor bug fixes to lib/pref/WmDefault.* files,
	   a Package for making Tix apps use the CDE/GNOME/KDE/Windows scheme.
	   GNOME is still barely supported because of the difficulty

	5) Updated old /README and /docs/FAQ file, and added Roadmap.html.
	6) Fixed bug with -debug in library/Init.tcl
	7) Chamged demos/widget to demos/tixwidgets.tcl
	8) Made sure default target for windows make is all not install.
	9) Begin removing subwidget optiondb for things like *entries,
	*scrollbars, *text, .background, etc - remove them next from schemes.
