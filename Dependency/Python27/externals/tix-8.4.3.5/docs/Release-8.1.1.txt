Release notes for 8.1.1

	See Release-8.1.0.txt

Changes for 8.1.1

	1) Added tixDebug procedure. To activate debugging messages, use
		tix configure -debug
	2) Minor bug fixes.
	3) Bulletproofed ComboBox.tcl against a bug showing up under Python.
	4) Fixed Windows to properly handle TCL_STORAGE_CLASS with USE_TCL_STUBS
	5) Fixed TkConsole declarations in tixWinMain.c
	6) Added winDumpExts.c for 8.3 - should change to use Tcl 8.3's method.
	7) Rewrote the patches to Tkinter.py so it will work with or without Tix.
	8) Updated README files to say that Tix should now build under 8.3,
	   but it's not "supported" in that it hasn't been tested on it yet.
