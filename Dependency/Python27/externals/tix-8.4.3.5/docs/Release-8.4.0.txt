        ---   Tix 8.4.0 Release Notes   ---

CHANGES
=======

    For a full list of the changes, see ChangeLog in the parent
    directory. Here's a list of the major changes and improvements:

    + Complete rewrite of the build system to use TEA
    + Separation of Tix package require and Tix style usage
    + Code cleanup to use Tcl 8.4 as a base version

    The python binding has not been updated and may require some
    maintenance work to function with this release.


DOWNLOAD TIX
============

    The sources to this release of Tix can be downloaded from

        http://tix.sourceforge.net/

    You also need to download Tcl and Tk sources from

        http://www.tck.tk/

BUILD TIX
=========

1. Uncompress and unpack the distribution

   ON UNIX / OS X:
	gzip -cd Tix<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -

   ON WINDOWS:
	use something like WinZip to unpack the archive.

   Because of major changes in the build system, you may run into
   difficulties when building Tix. Do not despair. If you have
   questions, bug reports or, better yet, bug fixes, please send post
   them on http://tix.sourceforge.net.

2. Configure

   ON UNIX / OS X:
        cd Tix<version>
	./configure

   Tix uses information left in tkConfig.sh when you built tk.  This
   file will be found in $exec_prefix/lib/.  You might set the --prefix and
   --exec-prefix options of configure if you don't want the default
   (/usr/local).  If building on multiple unix platforms, the following is
   recommended to isolate build conflicts:
	mkdir <builddir>/<platform>
	cd !$
	/path/to/Tix<version>/configure

   ON WINDOWS:

   Version 8.4 added support for building in the cygwin environment on
   Windows based on TEA (http://www.tcl.tk/doc/tea/).  You can retrieve
   cygwin from:
	http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/

   Inside the cygwin environment, you build the same as on Unix.

   Otherwise, hack makefile.vc until it works and compile.  It has problems
   executing wish from a path with a space in it, but the DLL builds just
   fine.  A DLL should be available where you found this archive.

3. Make and Install

   ON UNIX, OS X or WINDOWS (with cygwin):
	make
	make test (OPTIONAL)
	make install

   ON WINDOWS (makefile.vc):
	nmake -f makefile.vc
	nmake -f makefile.vc test (OPTIONAL)
	nmake -f makefile.vc install

RUN TESTS AND DEMOS
===================

    Refer to the win/README.txt and unix/README.txt files for
    instructions. You just need to type "make test" and "make
    rundemos" in most cases.

FEEDBACK
========

    Please send us feedback so that we know about the quality of this
    release. If it works fine, consider sending us a message such as
    "it works" and noting the versions of OS, Tcl/Tk and other
    relevant components. If you encounter problems, please let us know
    so that we can fix them. 

    Again, thank you for helping with Tix testing.
