Berkeley DB Java API<br>
<a href="{@docRoot}/../ref/toc.html" target="_top">[reference guide]</a> <a href="{@docRoot}/../ref/java/program.html" target="_top">[Java programming notes]</a>.
<p>
This package is a wrapper around the Berkeley DB library.  It uses JNI
to provide access to Berkeley DB, which is implemented in C.  That means
that a shared library or DLL must be available when applications use
this package.
<p>
There are also several utilities provided with Berkeley DB that make
administrative tasks possible from the command line.  For more
information, see the page <a href="{@docRoot}/../utility/index.html"
target="_top">Berkeley DB Supporting Utilities</a>.
