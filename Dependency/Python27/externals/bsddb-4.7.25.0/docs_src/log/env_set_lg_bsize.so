m4_p([dnl
When the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging, the
default size of the in-memory log buffer is approximately 32KB.  Log
information is stored in-memory until the storage space fills up or
transaction commit forces the information to be flushed to stable
storage.  In the presence of long-running transactions or transactions
producing large amounts of data, larger buffer sizes can increase
throughput.])

m4_p([dnl
When the logging subsystem is configured for in-memory logging, the
default size of the in-memory log buffer is 1MB.  Log information is
stored in-memory until the storage space fills up or transaction abort
or commit frees up the memory for new transactions.  In the presence of
long-running transactions or transactions producing large amounts of
data, the buffer size must be sufficient to hold all log information
that can accumulate during the longest running transaction.  When
choosing log buffer and file sizes for in-memory logs, applications
should ensure the in-memory log buffer size is large enough that no
transaction will ever span the entire buffer, and avoid a state where
the in-memory buffer is full and no space can be freed because a
transaction that started in the first log "file" is still active.])
