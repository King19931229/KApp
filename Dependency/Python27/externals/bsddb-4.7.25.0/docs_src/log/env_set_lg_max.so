m4_p([dnl
When the logging subsystem is configured for in-memory logging, the
default size of a log file is 256KB.  In addition, the configured log
buffer size must be larger than the log file size.  (The logging
subsystem divides memory configured for in-memory log records into
"files", as database environments configured for in-memory log records
may exchange log records with other members of a replication group, and
those members may be configured to store log records on-disk.)  When
choosing log buffer and file sizes for in-memory logs, applications
should ensure the in-memory log buffer size is large enough that no
transaction will ever span the entire buffer, and avoid a state where
the in-memory buffer is full and no space can be freed because a
transaction that started in the first log "file" is still active.])
