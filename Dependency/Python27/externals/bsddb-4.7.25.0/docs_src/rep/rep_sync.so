m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(rep_sync) forces master synchronization to begin for this
client.  This method is the other half of setting the
m4_ref(DB_REP_CONF_DELAYCLIENT) flag via the m4_refT(rep_set_config).])

m4_p([dnl
If an application has configured delayed master synchronization, the
application must synchronize explicitly (otherwise the client will
remain out-of-date and will ignore all database changes forwarded from
the replication group master).  The m4_refT(rep_sync) may be called any
time after the client application learns that the new master has been
established (by receiving a m4_ref(DB_EVENT_REP_NEWMASTER) event
notification).])
