The number of times a message critical for maintaining database
integrity (for example, a transaction commit), originating at this site,
did not receive sufficient acknowledgement from clients, according to
the configured acknowledgement policy and acknowledgement timeout.])

m4_field(u_int32_t, st_msgs_queued, [dnl
The number of outgoing messages which could not be transmitted
immediately, due to a full network buffer, and had to be queued for
later delivery.])

m4_field(u_int32_t, st_msgs_dropped, [dnl
The number of outgoing messages that were completely dropped, because
the outgoing message queue was full.  (m4_db replication is tolerant of
dropped messages, and will automatically request retransmission of any
missing messages as needed.)])

m4_field(u_int32_t, st_connection_drop, [dnl
The number of times an existing TCP/IP connection failed.])

m4_field(u_int32_t, st_connect_fail, [dnl
The number of times an attempt to open a new TCP/IP connection failed.])
