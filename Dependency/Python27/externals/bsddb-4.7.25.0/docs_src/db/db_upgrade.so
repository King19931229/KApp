m4_p([dnl
As part of the upgrade from the m4_db 3.0 release to the 3.1 release,
the on-disk format of duplicate data items changed.  To correctly
upgrade the format requires applications to specify whether duplicate
data items in the database are sorted or not.  Specifying the
m4_ref(DB_DUPSORT) flag informs m4_ref(dbh_upgrade) that the duplicates
are sorted; otherwise they are assumed to be unsorted.  Incorrectly
specifying the value of this flag may lead to database corruption.])
m4_p([dnl
Further, because the m4_refT(dbh_upgrade) upgrades a physical file
(including all the databases it contains), it is not possible to use
m4_ref(dbh_upgrade) to upgrade files in which some of the databases it
includes have sorted duplicate data items, and some of the databases it
includes have unsorted duplicate data items.  If the file does not have
more than a single database, if the databases do not support duplicate
data items, or if all of the databases that support duplicate data items
support the same style of duplicates (either sorted or unsorted),
m4_ref(dbh_upgrade) will work correctly as long as the
m4_ref(DB_DUPSORT) flag is correctly specified.  Otherwise, the file
cannot be upgraded using m4_ref(dbh_upgrade); it must be upgraded
manually by dumping and reloading the databases.])])
