m4_p([dnl
Almost all of the configuration information that can be specified to
m4_ref(DbEnv) methods can also be specified using a configuration file.
If a file named m4_ref(DB_CONFIG) exists in the database home directory,
it will be read for lines of the format m4_bold([NAME VALUE]).])

m4_p([dnl
One or more whitespace characters are used to delimit the two parts of
the line, and trailing whitespace characters are discarded.  All empty
lines or lines whose first character is a whitespace or hash
(m4_bold([#])) character will be ignored.  Each line must specify both
the NAME and the VALUE of the pair.  The specific NAME VALUE pairs are
documented in the manual for the corresponding methods (for example,
the m4_ref(dbenv_set_data_dir) documentation includes NAME VALUE pair
information m4_db administrators can use to configure locations for
database files).])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(DB_CONFIG) configuration file is intended to allow database
environment administrators to customize environments independent of
applications using the environment.  For example, a database
administrator can move the database log and data files to a different
location without application recompilation.  In addition, because the
m4_ref(DB_CONFIG) file is read when the database environment is opened,
it can be used to overrule application configuration done before that
time.  For example a database administrator could override the
compiled-in application cache size to a size more appropriate for a
specific machine.])
