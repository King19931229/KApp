m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Release 4.5: Recno backing text source files,,
    upgrade.4.5/config, upgrade.4.5/applog)

m4_p([dnl
In previous releases of m4_db, Recno access method backing source text
files were opened using the ANSI C fopen function with the "r" and "w"
modes.  This caused Windows systems to translate carriage-return and
linefeed characters on input and output and could lead to database
corruption.])

m4_p([dnl
In the current release, m4_db opens the backing source text files using
the "rb" and "wb" modes, consequently carriage-return and linefeed
characters will not be translated on Windows systems.])

m4_p([dnl
Applications using the backing source text file feature on systems where
the "r/w" and "rb/wb" modes differ should evaluate their application as part
of upgrading to the 4.5 release.  There is the possibility that
characters have been translated or stripped and the backing source file
has been corrupted.  (Applications on other systems, for example,
POSIX-like systems, should not require any changes related to this
issue.)])
