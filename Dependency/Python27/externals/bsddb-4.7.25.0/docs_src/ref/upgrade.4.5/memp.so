m4_p([dnl
As part of implementing support for multi-version concurrency control,
the m4_ref(DB_MPOOL_DIRTY) flag is now specified to the
m4_refT(memp_fget) instead of m4_ref(memp_fput), and the
DB_MPOOLFILE-__GT__set method has been removed.  In addition, a new
transaction handle parameter has been added to the m4_refT(memp_fget).])

m4_p([dnl
The DB_MPOOL_CLEAN flag is no longer supported.])

m4_p([dnl
Applications which use the memory pool API directly should update to
the new API in order to use 4.5.])
