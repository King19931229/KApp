    Release 4.5: --enable-pthread_self,,
    upgrade.4.5/collect, upgrade.4.5/source)

m4_p([dnl
In previous releases, the --enable-pthread_self configuration option was
used to force m4_db to use the POSIX pthread pthread_self function to
identify threads of control (even when m4_db was configured for
test-and-set mutexes).  In the 4.5 release, the --enable-pthread_self
option has been replaced with the
m4_linkpage(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/conf, --enable-pthread_api,
--with-enable-pthread_api) option.  This option has the same effect as
the previous option, but configures the m4_db build for a POSIX pthread
application in other ways (for example, configuring m4_db to use the
pthread_self function).])
