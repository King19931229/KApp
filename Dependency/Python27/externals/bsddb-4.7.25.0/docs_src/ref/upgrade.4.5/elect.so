m4_p([dnl
Two of the historic arguments for the m4_refT(rep_elect) have been moved
from the interface to separate methods in order to make them available
within the new replication manager framework.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_arg(priority) parameter should now be explicitly set using the
m4_refT(rep_set_priority).  To upgrade existing replication applications
to the m4_db 4.5 m4_ref(rep_elect) interface, it may be simplest to
insert a call to m4_ref(rep_set_priority) immediately before the
existing call to m4_ref(rep_elect).  Alternatively, it may make more
sense to add a single call to m4_ref(rep_set_priority) during database
environment configuration.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_arg(timeout) parameter should now be explicitly set using the
m4_refT(rep_set_timeout).  To upgrade existing replication applications
to the m4_db 4.5 m4_ref(rep_elect) interface, it may be simplest to
insert a call to m4_ref(rep_set_timeout) immediately before the existing
call to m4_ref(rep_elect).  Alternatively, it may make more sense to add
a single call to m4_ref(rep_set_timeout) during database environment
configuration.])
