m4_p([dnl
In previous m4_db releases, the DB_ENV-__GT__set_paniccall and
DB-__GT__set_paniccall methods were used to register a callback
function, called if the database environment failed.  In the 4.5
release, this functionality has been replaced by a general-purpose event
notification callback function, set with the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_event_notify).  Applications should be updated to
replace DB_ENV-__GT__set_paniccall and DB-__GT__set_paniccall calls with
a call to m4_ref(dbenv_set_event_notify).  This also requires the
callback function itself change, as the callback signatures are
different.])

m4_p([dnl
The DB_ENV-__GT__set_paniccall and DB-__GT__set_paniccall calls are
expected to be removed in a future release of m4_db.])
