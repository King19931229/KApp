m4_p([dnl
The original Perl module for m4_db was DB_File, which was written to
interface to m4_db version 1.85.  The newer Perl module for m4_db is
BerkeleyDB, which was written to interface to version 2.0 and subsequent
releases.  Because m4_db version 2.X has a compatibility API for version
1.85, you can (and should!) build DB_File using version 2.X of m4_db,
although DB_File will still only support the 1.85 functionality.])

m4_p([dnl
DB_File is distributed with the standard Perl source distribution (look
in the directory "ext/DB_File").  You can find both DB_File and BerkeleyDB
on CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network of mirrored FTP sites.
The master CPAN site is
m4_linkweb(ftp://ftp.funet.fi/, ftp://ftp.funet.fi/).])

m4_p([dnl
Versions of both BerkeleyDB and DB_File that are known to work correctly
with each release of m4_db are included in the distributed m4_db source
tree, in the subdirectories m4_path(perl.BerkeleyDB) and
m4_path(perl.DB_File).  Each of those directories contains a
m4_path(README) file with instructions on installing and using those
modules.])

m4_p([dnl
The Perl interface is not maintained by Oracle.  Questions about the
DB_File and BerkeleyDB modules are best asked on the Usenet newsgroup
comp.lang.perl.modules.])
