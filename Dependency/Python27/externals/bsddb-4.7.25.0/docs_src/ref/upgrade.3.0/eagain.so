    Release 3.0: EAGAIN,, upgrade.3.0/lock_notheld, upgrade.3.0/eacces)

m4_p([dnl
Historically, the m4_db interfaces have returned the POSIX error value
EAGAIN to indicate a deadlock.  This has been removed from the m4_db 3.0
release in order to make it possible for applications to distinguish
between EAGAIN errors returned by the system and returns from m4_db
indicating deadlock.])

m4_p([dnl
The application should be searched for any occurrences of EAGAIN. For
each of these, any that are checking for a deadlock return from m4_db
should be changed to check for the DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK return value.])

m4_p([dnl
If, for any reason, this is a difficult change for the application to
make, the m4_path(include/db.src) distribution file should be modified to
translate all returns of DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK to EAGAIN.  Search for the
string EAGAIN in that file, there is a comment that describes how to make
the change.])
