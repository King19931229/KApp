m4_p([dnl
Historically, the last two arguments to the m4_refT(dbh_join) were a
flags value followed by a reference to a memory location to store the
returned cursor object.  In the m4_db 3.0 release, the order of those
two arguments has been swapped for consistency with other m4_db
interfaces.])

m4_p([dnl
The application should be searched for any occurrences of m4_ref(dbh_join).
For each of these, the order of the last two arguments should be swapped.])
