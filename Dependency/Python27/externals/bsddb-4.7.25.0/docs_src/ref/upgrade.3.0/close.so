m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Release 3.0: DB-__GT__sync and DB-__GT__close,,
    upgrade.3.0/stat, upgrade.3.0/lock_put)

m4_p([dnl
In previous m4_db releases, the m4_ref(dbh_close) and m4_refT(dbh_sync)s
discarded any return of DB_INCOMPLETE from the underlying buffer
pool interfaces, and returned success to its caller.  (The
DB_INCOMPLETE error will be returned if the buffer pool functions
are unable to flush all of the database's dirty blocks from the pool.
This often happens if another thread is reading or writing the database's
pages in the pool.)])

m4_p([dnl
In the 3.X release, m4_ref(dbh_sync) and m4_ref(dbh_close) will return
DB_INCOMPLETE to the application.  The best solution is to not
call m4_ref(dbh_sync) and specify the m4_ref(DB_NOSYNC) flag to the
m4_refT(dbh_close) when multiple threads are expected to be accessing the
database.  Alternatively, the caller can ignore any error return of
DB_INCOMPLETE.])
