m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Release 3.0: db_xa_open,, upgrade.3.0/open, upgrade.3.0/db)

m4_p([dnl
The following change applies only to applications using m4_db as an XA
Resource Manager.  If your application is not using m4_db in this way,
you can ignore this change.])

m4_p([dnl
The db_xa_open function has been replaced with the m4_ref(DB_XA_CREATE)
flag to the m4_ref(dbh_create) function.  All calls to db_xa_open should
be replaced with calls to m4_ref(dbh_create) with the m4_ref(DB_XA_CREATE)
flag set, followed by a call to the m4_ref(dbh_open) function.])

m4_p([dnl
A similar change has been made for the C++ API, where the
m4_ref(DB_XA_CREATE) flag should be specified to the Db constructor. All
calls to the Db::xa_open method should be replaced with the
m4_ref(DB_XA_CREATE) flag to the Db constructor, followed by a call to
the DB::open method.])
