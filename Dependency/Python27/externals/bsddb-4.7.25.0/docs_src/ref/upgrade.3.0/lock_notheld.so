m4_p([dnl
Historically, the m4_db lock_put and lock_vec interfaces could return
the DB_LOCK_NOTHELD error to indicate that a lock could not be released
as it was held by another locker.  This error can no longer be returned
under any circumstances.  The application should be searched for any
occurrences of DB_LOCK_NOTHELD.  For each of these, the test and any
error processing should be removed.])
