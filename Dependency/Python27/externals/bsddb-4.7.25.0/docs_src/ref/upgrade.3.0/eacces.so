There was an error in previous releases of the m4_db documentation that
said that the lock_put and lock_vec interfaces could return EACCES as
an error to indicate that a lock could not be released because it was
held by another locker.  The application should be searched for any
occurrences of EACCES. For each of these, any that are checking for an
error return from lock_put or lock_vec should have the test and any
error handling removed.])
