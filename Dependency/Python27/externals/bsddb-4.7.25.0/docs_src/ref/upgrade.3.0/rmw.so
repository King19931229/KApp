m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Release 3.0: DB_RMW,, upgrade.3.0/txn_stat, upgrade.3.0/lock_notheld)

m4_p([dnl
The following change applies only to applications using the
m4_cam product.  If your application is not using that product,
you can ignore this change.])

m4_p([dnl
Historically, the m4_refT(dbh_cursor) took the DB_RMW flag to indicate
that the created cursor would be used for write operations on the
database.  This flag has been renamed to the m4_ref(DB_WRITECURSOR)
flag.])

m4_p([dnl
The application should be searched for any occurrences of DB_RMW. For
each of these, any that are arguments to the m4_ref(dbh_cursor) function
should be changed to pass in the m4_ref(DB_WRITECURSOR) flag instead.])
