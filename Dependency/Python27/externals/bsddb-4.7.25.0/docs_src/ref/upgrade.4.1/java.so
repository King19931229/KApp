m4_p([dnl
The Java DbEnv constructor is now marked with "throws DbException".
This means applications must construct DbEnv objects in a context where
DbException throwables are handled (either in a try/catch block or in a
method that propagates the exception up the stack).  Note that previous
versions of the m4_db Java API could throw this exception from the
constructor but it was not marked.])
