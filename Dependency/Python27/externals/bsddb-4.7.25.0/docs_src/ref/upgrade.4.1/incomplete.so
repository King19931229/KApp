m4_p([dnl
The DB_INCOMPLETE error has been removed from the 4.1 release, and is
no longer returned by the m4_db library.   Applications no longer need
to check for this error return, as the underlying m4_db interfaces that
could historically fail to checkpoint or flush the cache and return this
error can no longer fail for that reason.  Applications should remove
all uses of DB_INCOMPLETE.])

m4_p([dnl
Additionally, the DbEnv.checkpoint and Db.sync methods have been changed
from returning int to returning void.])
