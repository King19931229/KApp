    upgrade.4.1/cxx, upgrade.4.1/disk)

m4_p([dnl
The application-specific logging and recovery tools and interfaces have
been reworked in the 4.1 release to make it simpler for applications to
use m4_db to support their own logging and recovery of non-m4_db
objects.  Specifically, the DB_ENV-__GT__set_recovery_init and
DB_ENV-__GT__set_tx_recover interfaces have been removed, replaced by
m4_ref(dbenv_set_app_dispatch).  Applications using either of the
removed interfaces should be updated to call
m4_ref(dbenv_set_app_dispatch).  For more information see
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/apprec/intro, "Application-specific logging and
recovery") and the m4_ref(dbenv_set_app_dispatch) documentation.])
