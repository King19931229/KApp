m4_p([dnl
The density, or page fill factor, is an approximation of the number of
keys allowed to accumulate in any one bucket, determining when the hash
table grows or shrinks.  If you know the average sizes of the keys and
data in your data set, setting the fill factor can enhance performance.
A reasonable rule to use to compute fill factor is:])

m4_indent([(pagesize - 32) / (average_key_size + average_data_size + 8)])

m4_p([dnl
The desired density within the hash table can be specified by calling
the m4_refT(dbh_set_h_ffactor).  If no density is specified, one will
be selected dynamically as pages are filled.])
