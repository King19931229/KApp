m4_p([dnl
m4_db allocates memory for returning key/data pairs and statistical
information which becomes the responsibility of the application.
There are also interfaces where an application will allocate memory
which becomes the responsibility of m4_db.])

m4_p([dnl
On systems in which there may be multiple library versions of the
standard allocation routines (notably Windows NT), transferring memory
between the library and the application will fail because the m4_db
library allocates memory from a different heap than the application
uses to free it, or vice versa.  To avoid this problem, the
m4_ref(dbenv_set_alloc) and m4_refT(dbh_set_alloc)s can be used to
give m4_db references to the application's allocation routines.])
