    Release 3.2: DB_ENV-__GT__set_flags,,
    upgrade.3.2/intro, upgrade.3.2/callback)

m4_p([dnl
A new method has been added to the m4_db environment handle,
m4_ref(dbenv_set_flags).  This method currently takes three flags:
m4_ref(DB_CDB_ALLDB), m4_ref(DB_NOMMAP) and m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC).  The
first of these flags, m4_ref(DB_CDB_ALLDB), provides new functionality,
allowing m4_cam applications to do locking across multiple databases.])

m4_p([dnl
The other two flags, m4_ref(DB_NOMMAP) and m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC), were
specified to the m4_ref(dbenv_open) method in previous releases.  In
the 3.2 release, they have been moved to the m4_refT(dbenv_set_flags)
because this allows the database environment's value to be toggled
during the life of the application as well as because it is a more
appropriate place for them.  Applications specifying either the
m4_ref(DB_NOMMAP) or m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC) flags to the
m4_refT(dbenv_open) should replace those flags with calls to the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_flags).])
