m4_p([dnl
In previous releases of m4_db, Java DbEnv and Db objects, and C++
m4_refcxx(DbEnv) and m4_refcxx(Db) objects could be reused after they
were closed, by calling open on them again.  This is no longer
permitted, and these objects no longer allow any operations after a
close.  Applications reusing these objects should be modified to create
new objects instead.])
