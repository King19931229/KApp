m4_p([dnl
Previous m4_db releases included the db_env_set_mutexlocks function,
intended for debugging, that allows applications to always obtain
requested mutual exclusion mutexes without regard for their
availability.  This function has been replaced with
dbenv_set_mutexlocks, which provides the same functionality on a
per-database environment basis.  Applications using the old function
should be updated to use the new one.])
