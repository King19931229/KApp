    Release 3.2: DB_ENV-__GT__set_tx_recover,,
    upgrade.3.2/incomplete, upgrade.3.2/mutexlock)

m4_p([dnl
The m4_arg(info) parameter of the function passed to
DB_ENV-__GT__set_tx_recover is no longer needed.  If your application
calls DB_ENV-__GT__set_tx_recover, find the callback function referred
to by that call and remove the m4_arg(info) parameter.])

m4_p([dnl
In addition, the called function no longer needs to handle m4_db log
records, m4_db will handle them internally as well as call the
application-specified function.  Any handling of m4_db log records in the
application's callback function may be removed.])

m4_p([dnl
In addition, the callback function will no longer be called with the
m4_ref(DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL) flag specified unless the transaction
enclosing the operation successfully committed.])
