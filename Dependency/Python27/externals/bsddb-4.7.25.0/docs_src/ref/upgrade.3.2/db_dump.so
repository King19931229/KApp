m4_p([dnl
In previous releases of m4_db, the m4_ref(db_dump) utility dumped Recno
access method database keys as numeric strings.  For consistency, the
m4_ref(db_dump) utility has been changed in the 3.2 release to dump
record numbers as hex pairs when the data items are being dumped as hex
pairs.  (See the m4_option(k) and m4_option(p) options to the
m4_ref(db_dump) utility for more information.) Any applications or
scripts post-processing the m4_ref(db_dump) output of Recno databases
under these conditions may require modification.])
