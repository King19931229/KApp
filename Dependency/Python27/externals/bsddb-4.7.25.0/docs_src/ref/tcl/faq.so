m4_p([dnl
To compile the Tcl interface with a particular version of Tcl, use the
--with-tcl option to specify the Tcl installation directory that
contains the tclConfig.sh file.  See
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/flags, [Changing compile or load
options]) for more information.])])

m4_p([dnl
Also, some systems do not search for shared libraries by default, or do
not search for shared libraries named the way the Tcl installation names
them, or are searching for a different kind of library than those in
your Tcl installation.  For example, Linux systems often require linking
"libtcl.a" to "libtcl#.#.a", whereas AIX systems often require adding the
"-brtl" flag to the linker.  A simpler solution that almost always works
on all systems is to create a link from "libtcl.#.#.a" or "libtcl.so"
(or whatever you happen to have) to "libtcl.a" and reconfigure.])])

m4_bold([Loading the m4_db library into Tcl on AIX causes a core dump.])

m4_p([dnl
In some versions of Tcl, the "tclConfig.sh" autoconfiguration script
created by the Tcl installation does not work properly under AIX, and
you may have to modify values in the tclConfig.sh file to in order to
load the m4_db library into Tcl.  Specifically, the TCL_LIB_SPEC
variable should contain sufficient linker flags to find and link against
the installed libtcl library.  In some circumstances, the tclConfig.sh
file built by Tcl does not.])])
