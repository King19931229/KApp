m4_p([dnl
The C API for the m4_db Transaction subsystem was reworked in the 4.0
release as follows:])

m4_table_begin(, _center)
m4_table_header(Historic functional interface, m4_db 4.X method)
m4_table_element(txn_abort, m4_ref(txn_abort))
m4_table_element(txn_begin, m4_ref(txn_begin))
m4_table_element(txn_checkpoint, m4_ref(txn_checkpoint))
m4_table_element(txn_commit, m4_ref(txn_commit))
m4_table_element(txn_discard, m4_ref(txn_discard))
m4_table_element(txn_id, m4_ref(txn_id))
m4_table_element(txn_prepare, m4_ref(txn_prepare))
m4_table_element(txn_recover, m4_ref(txn_recover))
m4_table_element(txn_stat, m4_ref(txn_stat))
m4_table_end

m4_p([dnl
Applications calling any of these functions should update their calls
to use the enclosing m4_ref(DbEnv) or m4_ref(DbTxn) handle's method
(easily done as the first argument to the existing call is the correct
handle to use).])

m4_p([dnl
As a special case, since applications might potentially have many calls
to the txn_abort, txn_begin and txn_commit functions, those functions
continue to work unchanged in the m4_db 4.0 release.])

m4_p([dnl
In addition, the m4_ref(txn_stat) call has been changed in the 4.0
release to take a flags argument.  To leave their historic behavior
unchanged, applications should add a final argument of 0 to any calls
made to m4_ref(txn_stat).])
