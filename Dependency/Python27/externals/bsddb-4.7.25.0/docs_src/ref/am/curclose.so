m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(dbc_close) closes the m4_ref(Dbc) cursor, after which the
cursor may no longer be used.  Although cursors are implicitly closed
when the database they point to are closed, it is good programming
practice to explicitly close cursors.  In addition, in transactional
systems, cursors may not exist outside of a transaction and so must be
explicitly closed.])
