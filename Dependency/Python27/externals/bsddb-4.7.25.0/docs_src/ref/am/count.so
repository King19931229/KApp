Once a cursor has been initialized to refer to a particular key in the
database, it can be used to determine the number of data items that are
stored for any particular key.  The m4_ref(dbc_count) method returns
this number of data items.  The returned value is always one, unless
the database supports duplicate data items, in which case it may be any
number of items.])
