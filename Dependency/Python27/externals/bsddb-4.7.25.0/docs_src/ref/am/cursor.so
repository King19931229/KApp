m4_p([dnl
A database cursor refers to a single key/data pair in the database.  It
supports traversal of the database and is the only way to access
individual duplicate data items.  Cursors are used for operating on
collections of records, for iterating over a database, and for saving
handles to individual records, so that they can be modified after they
have been read.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(dbh_cursor) opens a cursor into a database.  Upon return the
cursor is uninitialized, cursor positioning occurs as part of the first
cursor operation.])

m4_p([dnl
Once a database cursor has been opened, records may be retrieved
(m4_ref(dbc_get)), stored (m4_ref(dbc_put)), and deleted
(m4_ref(dbc_del)).])

m4_p([dnl
Additional operations supported by the cursor handle include duplication
(m4_ref(dbc_dup)), equality join (m4_ref(dbh_join)), and a count of
duplicate data items (m4_ref(dbc_count)).  Cursors are eventually closed
using m4_ref(dbc_close).])
