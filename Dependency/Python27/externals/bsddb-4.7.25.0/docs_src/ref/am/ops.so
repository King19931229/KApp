m4_p([dnl
Once a database handle has been created using m4_ref(dbh_create), there
are several standard access method operations.  Each of these operations
is performed using a method referred to by the returned handle.
Generally, the database will be opened using m4_ref(dbh_open).  If the
database is from an old release of m4_db, it may need to be upgraded to
the current release before it is opened using m4_ref(dbh_upgrade).])

m4_p([dnl
Once a database has been opened, records may be retrieved (m4_ref(dbh_get)),
stored (m4_ref(dbh_put)), and deleted (m4_ref(dbh_del)).])

m4_p([dnl
Additional operations supported by the database handle include
statistics (m4_ref(dbh_stat)), truncation (m4_ref(dbh_truncate)),
version upgrade (m4_ref(dbh_upgrade)), verification and salvage
(m4_ref(dbh_verify)), flushing to a backing file (m4_ref(dbh_sync)),
and association of secondary indices (m4_ref(dbh_associate)).  Database
handles are eventually closed using m4_ref(dbh_close).])
