m4_p([dnl
The m4_db access methods provide no guarantees about byte alignment for
returned key/data pairs, or callback functions which take m4_ref(Dbt)
references as arguments, and applications are responsible for arranging
any necessary alignment.  The m4_ref(DB_DBT_MALLOC),
m4_ref(DB_DBT_REALLOC) and m4_ref(DB_DBT_USERMEM) flags may be used to
store returned items in memory of arbitrary alignment.])
