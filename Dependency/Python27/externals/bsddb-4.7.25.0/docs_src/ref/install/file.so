m4_p([dnl
The m4_manref(file, 1) utility is a UNIX utility that examines and
classifies files, based on information found in its database of file
types, the /etc/magic file.  The following information may be added
to your system's /etc/magic file to enable m4_manref(file, 1) to
correctly identify m4_db database files.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_manref(file, 1) utility m4_manref(magic, 5) information for the
standard System V UNIX implementation of the m4_manref(file, 1) utility
is included in the m4_db distribution for both
m4_linkweb(magic.s5.be.txt, big-endian) (for example, Sparc) and
m4_linkweb(magic.s5.le.txt, little-endian) (for example, x86) architectures.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_manref(file, 1) utility m4_manref(magic, 5) information for
Release 3.X of Ian Darwin's implementation of the file utility (as
distributed by FreeBSD and most Linux distributions) is included in the
m4_db distribution.  This m4_linkweb(magic.txt, magic.txt) information
is correct for both big-endian and little-endian architectures.])
