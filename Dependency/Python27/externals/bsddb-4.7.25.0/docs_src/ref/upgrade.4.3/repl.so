m4_p([dnl
The 4.3 release removes support for logs-only replication clients.  Use
of the DB_REP_LOGSONLY flag to the m4_ref(rep_start) should be replaced
with the m4_ref(DB_REP_CLIENT) flag.])

m4_p([dnl
The 4.3 release adds two new arguments to the m4_refT(rep_elect),
m4_arg(nvotes) and m4_arg(flags).  The m4_arg(nvotes) argument sets the
required number of replication group members that must participate in
an election in order for a master to be declared.  For backward
compatibility, set the m4_arg(nvotes) argument to 0.  The flags argument
is currently unused and should be set to 0.  See m4_refT(rep_elect) or
"Replication Elections" for more information.])

m4_p([dnl
In the 4.3 release it is no longer necessary to do a database
environment hot backup to initialize a replication client.  All that is
needed now is for the client to join the replication group.  m4_db will
perform an internal backup from the master to the client automatically
and will run recovery on the client to bring it up to date with the
master.])
