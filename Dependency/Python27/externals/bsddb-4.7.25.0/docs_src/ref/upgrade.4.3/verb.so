m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Release 4.3: DB_ENV-__GT__set_verbose,,
    upgrade.4.3/stat, upgrade.4.3/log)

m4_p([dnl
The 4.3 release removes support for the m4_refT(dbenv_set_verbose) flag
DB_VERB_CHKPOINT.  Application writers should simply remove any use of
this flag from their applications.])

m4_p([dnl
The 4.3 release redirects output configured by the m4_refT(dbenv_set_verbose)
from the error output channels (see the m4_ref(dbenv_set_errfile) and
m4_refT(dbenv_set_errcall)s for more information) to the new
m4_ref(dbenv_set_msgcall) and m4_ref(dbenv_set_msgfile) message output
channels.  This change means the error output channels are now only used
for errors, and not for debugging and performance tuning messages as
well as errors.  Application writers using m4_ref(dbenv_set_verbose)
should confirm that output is handled appropriately.])
