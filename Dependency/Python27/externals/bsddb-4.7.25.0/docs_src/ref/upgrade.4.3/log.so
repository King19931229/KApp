    Release 4.3: Logging,,
    upgrade.4.3/verb, upgrade.4.3/fileopen)

m4_p([dnl
In previous releases, the m4_refT(dbenv_set_flags) flag
DB_TXN_NOT_DURABLE specified that transactions for the entire database
environment were not durable.  However, it was not possible to set this
flag in environments that were part of replication groups, and physical
log files were still created.  The 4.3 release adds support for true
in-memory logging for both replication and non-replicated sites.])

m4_p([dnl
Existing applications setting the DB_TXN_NOT_DURABLE flag for database
environments should be upgraded to set the DB_LOG_INMEMORY flag instead.])

m4_p([dnl
In previous releases, log buffer sizes were restricted to be less than
or equal to the log file size; this restriction is no longer required.])
