m4_p([dnl
The DB_REP_FULL_ELECTION flag historically specified to the
m4_refT(repmgr_start) has been removed from the 4.6 release.])

m4_p([dnl
In the m4_db 4.6 release, a simpler and more flexible implementation of
this functionality is available.  Applications needing to configure the
first election of a replication group differently from subsequent
elections should use the m4_ref(DB_REP_FULL_ELECTION_TIMEOUT) flag to
the m4_refT(rep_set_timeout) to specify a different timeout for the
first election.])
