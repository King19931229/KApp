m4_p([dnl
In previous releases, the C++ m4_refcxx(dbh_del) and Java Db.delete
methods threw exceptions encapsulating the m4_ref(DB_KEYEMPTY) error in
some cases when called on Queue and Recno databases.  Unfortunately,
this was undocumented behavior.])

m4_p([dnl
For consistency with the other m4_db methods that handle
m4_ref(DB_KEYEMPTY), this is no longer the case.  Applications calling
the m4_refcxx(dbh_del) or Db.delete methods on Queue or Recno databases,
and handling the m4_ref(DB_KEYEMPTY) exception specially, should be
modified to check for a return value of m4_ref(DB_KEYEMPTY) instead.])
