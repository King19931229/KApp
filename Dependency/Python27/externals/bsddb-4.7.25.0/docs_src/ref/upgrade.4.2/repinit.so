m4_section(Replication initialization)
m4_p([dnl
In the m4_db 4.2 release, replication environments must be specifically
initialized by any process that will ever do anything other than open
databases in read-only mode (that is, any process which might call any
of the m4_db replication interfaces or modify databases).  This
initialization is done when the replication database environment handle
is opened, by specifying the m4_ref(DB_INIT_REP) flag to the
m4_refT(dbenv_open).])

m4_section(Database methods and replication clients)
m4_p([dnl
All of the m4_ref(Db) object methods may now return
m4_ref(DB_REP_HANDLE_DEAD) when a replication client changes masters.
When this happens the m4_ref(Db) handle is no longer able to be used and
the application must close the handle using the m4_refT(dbh_close) and
open a new handle.  This new return value is returned when a client
unrolls a transaction in order to synchronize with the new master.
Otherwise, if the application was permitted to use the original handle,
it's possible the handle might attempt to access nonexistent resources.])

m4_section(m4_ref(rep_message))
m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(rep_message) has new return values and an log sequence
number (LSN) associated with those return values.  The new argument is
m4_arg(ret_lsnp), which is the returned LSN when the
m4_refT(rep_message) returns m4_ref(DB_REP_ISPERM) or
m4_ref(DB_REP_NOTPERM).  See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/rep/trans,
Transactional guarantees) for more information.])
