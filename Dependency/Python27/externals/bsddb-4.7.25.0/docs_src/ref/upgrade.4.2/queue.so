m4_p([dnl
We have discovered a problem where applications that specify m4_db's
encryption or data checksum features on Queue databases with extent
files, the database data will not be protected.  This is obviously a
security problem, and we encourage you to upgrade these applications to
the 4.2 release as soon as possible.])

m4_p([dnl
The Queue databases must be dumped and reloaded in order to fix this
problem.  First build the m4_db 4.2 release, then use your previous
release to dump the database, and the 4.2 release to reload the
database.  For example:])

m4_p([dnl
Note this is m4_bold(only) necessary for Queue access method databases,
where extent files were configured along with either encryption or
checksums.])
