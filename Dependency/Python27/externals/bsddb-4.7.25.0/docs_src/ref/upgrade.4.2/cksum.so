m4_p([dnl
The flag to enable checksumming of m4_db databases pages was renamed
from DB_CHKSUM_SHA1 to m4_ref(DB_CHKSUM), as m4_db uses an internal
function to generate hash values for unencrypted database pages, not
the SHA1 Secure Hash Algorithm.  m4_db continues to use the SHA1 Secure
Hash Algorithm to generate hashes for encrypted database pages.
Applications using the DB_CHKSUM_SHA1 flag should change that use to
m4_ref(DB_CHKSUM); no other change is required.])
