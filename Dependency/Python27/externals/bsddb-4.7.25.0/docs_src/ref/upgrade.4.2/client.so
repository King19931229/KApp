m4_p([dnl
The flag to create a client to connect to a RPC server was renamed from
DB_CLIENT to m4_ref(DB_RPCCLIENT), in order to avoid confusion between
RPC clients and replication clients.  Applications using the DB_CLIENT
flag should change that use to m4_ref(DB_RPCCLIENT); no other change is
required.])
