m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Release 4.2: DB-__GT__verify,,
    upgrade.4.2/priority, upgrade.4.2/lockng)

m4_p([dnl
In previous releases, applications calling the m4_refT(dbh_verify) had
to explicitly discard the m4_ref(Db) handle by calling the
m4_refT(dbh_close).  Further, using the m4_ref(Db) handle in other ways
after calling the m4_refT(dbh_verify) was not prohibited by the
documentation, although such use was likely to lead to problems.])

m4_p([dnl
For consistency with other m4_db methods, m4_refT(dbh_verify) has been
documented in the current release as a m4_ref(Db) handle destructor.
Applications using the m4_ref(Db) handle in any way (including calling
the m4_refT(dbh_close)) after calling m4_ref(dbh_verify) should be
updated to make no further use of any kind of the m4_ref(Db) handle
after m4_ref(dbh_verify) returns.])
