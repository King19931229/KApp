    Release 4.2: Client replication environments,,

m4_p([dnl
In previous m4_db releases, replication clients always behaved as if
m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC) behavior was configured, that is, clients would
not write or synchronously flush their log when receiving a transaction
commit or prepare message.  However, applications needing a high level
of transactional guarantee may need a write and synchronous flush on
the client.  By default in the m4_db 4.2 release, client database
environments write and synchronously flush their logs when receiving a
transaction commit or prepare message.  Applications not needing such
a high level of transactional guarantee should use the environment's
m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC) flag to configure their client database
environments to not do the write or flush on transaction commit, as this
will increase their performance.  Regardless of the setting of the
m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC) flag, clients will always write and flush on
transaction prepare.])
