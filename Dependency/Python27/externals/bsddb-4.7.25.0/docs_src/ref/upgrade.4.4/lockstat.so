m4_p([dnl
The names of two fields in the lock statistics changed in the m4_db 4.4
release.  The m4_arg(st_nconflicts) field was renamed to be
m4_arg(st_lock_wait), and the m4_arg(st_nnowaits) field was renamed to
be m4_arg(st_lock_nowait).  The meaning of the fields is unchanged
(although the documentation has been updated to make it clear what these
fields really represent).])
