m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Release 4.4: DB_AUTO_COMMIT,,
    upgrade.4.4/intro, upgrade.4.4/isolation)

m4_p([dnl
In previous m4_db releases, the m4_ref(DB_AUTO_COMMIT) flag was used in
the C and C++ m4_db APIs to wrap operations within a transaction without
explicitly creating a transaction and passing the m4_ref(DbTxn) handle
as part of the operation method call.  In the 4.4 release, the
m4_ref(DB_AUTO_COMMIT) flag no longer needs to be explicitly specified.])

m4_p([dnl
In the 4.4 release, specifying the m4_ref(DB_AUTO_COMMIT) flag to the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_flags) causes all database modifications in that
environment to be transactional; specifying m4_ref(DB_AUTO_COMMIT) to
the m4_refT(dbh_open) causes all modifications to that database to be
transactional; specifying m4_ref(DB_AUTO_COMMIT) to the
m4_ref(dbenv_dbremove) and m4_refT(dbenv_dbrename)s causes those
specific operations to be transactional.])

m4_p([dnl
No related application changes are required for this release, as the
m4_ref(DB_AUTO_COMMIT) flag is ignored where it is no longer needed.
However, application writers are encouraged to remove uses of the
m4_ref(DB_AUTO_COMMIT) flag in places where it is no longer needed.])

m4_p([dnl
Similar changes have been made to the m4_db Tcl API.  These changes are
not optional, and Tcl applications will need to remove the -auto_commit
flag from methods where it is no longer needed.])
