m4_p([dnl
The names of two isolation-level flags changed in the m4_db 4.4 release.
The DB_DEGREE_2 flag was renamed to m4_ref(DB_READ_COMMITTED), and the
DB_DIRTY_READ flag was renamed to m4_ref(DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED), to match
ANSI standard names for isolation levels.  The historic flag names
continue to work in this release, but may be removed from future
releases.])
