m4_p([dnl
This page has general instructions for building the m4_db library and
applications for the S60 platform.])

m4_p([dnl
Building m4_db for S60 requires S60 SDK version 3 or above with
Symbian V9.1 or above; the 3rd Edition FP1 SDK is recommended.])

m4_p([dnl
The NOKIA OpenC plugin should be installed on both emulator and device.])

m4_p([dnl
CodeWarrior IDE for S60 V3.1 is recommended.])

m4_section([dnl
Building m4_db for the S60 Emulator])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_path(build_s60) directory in the m4_db distribution contains
a m4_path(bdb_s60.mmp) project file, which can be imported to
CodeWarrior or Carbide, etc.  This project file can be used to build the
m4_db library for the S60 platform.])

m4_p([dnl
The steps for building the m4_db library for the S60 emulator are
as follows:])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([dnl
Install the S60 SDK and OpenC library.])
m4_nlist([dnl
In CodeWarrior, select m4_italic([File -__GT__ Import project from .mmp file]).])
m4_nlist([dnl
Select an SDK to use with this project: m4_italic([nokia -__GT__S60 S60_3rd_FP1]).])
m4_nlist([dnl
Click to browse for MMP file selection.  Look in the
m4_path(build_s60) directory for Workspaces and select
m4_italic(bdb_s60.mmp).])
m4_nlist([Click Next.])
m4_nlist([Click Finish.])
m4_nlist([dnl
Select build target to WINSCW UDEB, to build, press F7.])
m4_nlistend

m4_p([dnl
The build will create the file m4_path(bdb_s60.lib), which is
installed into m4_path($EPOCROOT/epoc32/ release/winscw/udeb), which can
be linked by m4_db applications for the emulator.])

m4_section([Building m4_db Library for the Device])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([dnl
Install the CSL Arm tool chain.])
m4_nlist([dnl
From m4_path($EPOCROOT/epoc32/release/armv5/lib), add OpenC library
libpthread.dso to the GCCE library(libc.dso already added).])
m4_nlist([dnl
Since m4_db uses old-style function definitions, it will not be accepted
by the default compiler:arm-none-symbianelf-g++.exe.  Change the
compiler to arm-none-symbianelf-gcc.exe and specify the "-x c" option
there.])
m4_nlist([dnl
Select build target to GCCE UREL, to build, press F7.])
m4_nlistend

m4_p([dnl
The build will create the file m4_path(bdb_s60.lib), which is
installed into m4_path($EPOCROOT/epoc32/ release/armv5/urel), which can
be linked by m4_db applications for device.])

m4_section([Building a S60 application with the m4_db library])

m4_p([dnl
Building a m4_db application in the S60 environment is similar
to building in a Windows environment.  Ensure the include file
m4_path(build_s60/db.h) is in the build include path and the created
m4_path(bdb_s60.lib) is in the build library path.])
