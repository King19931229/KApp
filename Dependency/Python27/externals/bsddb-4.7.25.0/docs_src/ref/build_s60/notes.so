m4_nlist([dnl
The stack size on the S60 is small by default, and the application will
silently fail if the stack is too small.  Setting EPOCSTACKSIZE to an
appropriate value in the application's mmp file will resolve this
problem.])

m4_nlist([dnl
The m4_db build on the S60 is a "small build", disabling some of the
m4_db library features.  This build is equivalent to the
m4_arg(--enable-smallbuild) configuration option described in
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/small, Building a small memory footprint
library).])
