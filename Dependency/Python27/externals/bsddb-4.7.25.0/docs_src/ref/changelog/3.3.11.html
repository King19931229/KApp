<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 3.3.11 Change Log</h3>

<h3>Major New Features:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Berkeley DB now continues to run when no disk space is available. [#637]
<li>Add Berkeley DB API support for bulk-data returns. [#2934]
<li>Add Berkeley DB API support for secondary indices. [#3329]
<li>Add support for degree 1 isolation (dirty reads). [#3395]
<li>Add support for native Berkeley DB two-phase commit.  This requires
an additional parameter to txn_prepare (a global transaction id), a new
interface that returns the list of prepared but not yet committed
transactions, and a new interface that supports transaction discard.  [#3563]
<li>Add support for the Embedix OS. [#3666]

</ol>
<h3>Interface Additions and Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>The new Db handle method DB-&gt;truncate supports discard of all
records in a database. [#1984]
<li>The DB_LOCK_CONFLICT flag has been removed. [#2606]
<li>The new DbEnv handle method DBENV-&gt;set_lg_regionmax method
supports sizing the logging subsystem's region. [#3509]
<li>Add support for deadlock resolution based on the transaction holding
the fewest, most, and most write locks. [#3020]
<li>Replace the DB-&gt;set_malloc and DB-&gt;set_realloc functions, and
the malloc arguments to DB-&gt;stat, lock_stat, log_archive, log_stat,
memp_stat and txn_stat, with the new DB_ENV-&gt;set_alloc and
DB-&gt;set_alloc interfaces. [#3329]
<li>Allow the DB-&gt;get_type and DB-&gt;get_byteswapped methods to
return error values. [#4071]

</ol>
<h3>General Environment Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where threads of control were not properly informed that
the database environment had failed with DB_RUNRECOVERY. [#3280]
<li>Fix a bug where it was impossible to remove or run recovery on a
database environment that had failed with DB_RUNRECOVERY. [#3280]
<li>Fix a bug where error messages could be lost when performing
recovery on a database environment as part of a DB-&gt;open call.
[#3340]
<li>Detect attempts to use DB handles inside transactions that were not
originally created in an environment that supports transactions. [#3406]
<li>Fix a bug where recovery could drop core when a subdatabase metadata
page was being recovered. [#3454]
<li>Fix bug where system mutex resources could be leaked when DB_THREAD
was specified, on OSE, VxWorks and QNX. [#3474]
<li>Fix a bug where the DBENV-&gt;set_feedback method could
cause a core dump if the database environment had no
existing log files. [#3894]


</ol>
<h3>General Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Add the DB_FAST_STAT option to the DB-&gt;stat method to return only
those database statistics that can be acquired without database
traversal. Deprecate the DB_CACHED_COUNTS and DB_RECORDCOUNT flags to
the DB-&gt;stat method. [#2090]
<li>Fix bugs in the salvager where various error cases failed to unpin
pages. [#2869]
<li>Fix a bug where join memory could be allocated using the wrong
allocation routines. [#3403]
<li>Fix a bug where a transaction handle could be used after it was
closed. [#3480]
<li>Fix a bug in which a join cursor get could unexpectedly fail, or
memory returned by a join cursor get could be freed or corrupted by
an unrelated call using the primary database handle. [#3749]
<li>Fix a bug in which DB-managed memory returned by a DB-&gt;get or
DB-&gt;put call may be corrupted by a later cursor call. [#3576]
<li>Fix a bug where file descriptors could be leaked when attempting
to open database files where the metadata page could not be read. [#3786]
<li>Fix a bug where the Db.open method could throw a DB_INCOMPLETE
exception. [#3885]
<li>Fix a bug in which partial gets that specify an offset and length
beyond the end of the record could return garbage data. [#4117]

</ol>
<h3>Btree Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where overwriting a previously deleted data item in a
sorted, off-page, duplicate set could fail. [#3617]
<li>Fix a bug where the Btree/Recno DB-&gt;stat method could
leave a page pinned. [#3761]

crash if cursors were open in the parent transaction. [#4002]

</ol>
<h3>Hash Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where memory could be freed and then returned to the
application. [#3506]

duplicate sets could cause a core dump. [#3975]
<li>Fix a bug where an error in converting from on-page to off-page
duplicate sets could leave a page pinned. [#3975]
<li>Fix a bug where aborting a child transaction could cause open cursors
belonging to a parent transaction to return corrupt or incomplete data. [#4002]
<li>Fix a class of bugs in which aborting a child transaction could cause a
hash cursor that pointed at a deleted item to start pointing at a different,
incorrect item. [#4052] [#4142]

</ol>
<h3>Queue Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Preserve Queue database extent size across dump/load cycles. [#3323]
<li>Fix a bug where calling the DB-&gt;stat method on an empty Queue
database opened in read-only mode dropped core. [#3333]

database could incorrectly return EIO. [#3670]
<li>Fix a bug where the delete of an extent file could be unrecoverable. [#3927]
<li>Improve concurrency in the Queue access method by removing a log
write made while holding a metapage lock during record append. [#3939]
<li>Fix a bug where the metapage lock was not released on error.  [#3998]
<li>Fix a bug where log_archive with the DB_ARCH_DATA flag specified
did not return the names of the extent files for Queue databases.  [#3968]

<h3>Recno Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug in which a DB-&gt;get(DB_GET_BOTH) or DBC-&gt;c_get(DB_GET_BOTH)
operation on a Recno database could erroneously return an item with
a matching datum but a different record number from that specified.
[#3878]

appear non-empty in a fixed-length Recno database with an re_len
greater than the threshold for moving items off-page.  [#2934]

<h3>Tcl API Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where memory guard bytes were incorrectly checked by the
Tcl txn_stat call. [#3431]
<li>Fix a bug in which values too large for a signed 32-bit integer,

DB interfaces, would be incorrectly rejected by the Tcl interface
on some platforms. [#4184]

</ol>
