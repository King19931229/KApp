<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 3.1.17 Change Log</h3>

<h3>Database On-Disk Format Changes:</h3>

<blockquote>None.</blockquote>

<h3>Major New Features:</h3>

<blockquote>None.</blockquote>

<h3>Interface Additions and Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>The documentation for DB-&gt;set_feedback stated that the third
argument to the callback function is "the percent of the operation
remaining to be completed, specified as an integer value between 0 and
100", implying that it's a countdown from 100 to 0.  The actual
implementation was to count upward from 0 to 100.  The documentation
has been changed to match the code. [#2310]

</ol>
<h3>General Environment Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where attempts to remove a region never returned. [#2379]
<li>Fix a typo in the freeing of the shared log region. [#2379]
<li>Remove the requirement that all threads of control using System V
shared memory for regions specify the base segment ID [#2379]
<li>Fix a bug where applications using different sets of regions in an
environment would fail when using System V shared memory for the regions.
[#2379]
<li>Fix a bug where the DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT flag was incorrectly tested,
using the environment for processes without sufficient privilege. [#2400]
<li>Fix a bug where the error prefix was ignored by the Db handle method
error calls. [#2484]
<li>Fix a bug where the db_archive utility could create an environment
that would cause applications or other Berkeley DB utilities to fail.  [#2524]

</ol>
<h3>General Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a memory leak in the DB-&gt;verify method. [#2347]
<li>Fix memory leaks in DB-&gt;rename and DB-&gt;remove method
recovery [#2363]
<li>Fix a bug in the DB-&gt;verify method where 64K pages with large
offsets were incorrectly verified. [#2408]
<li>Fix a bug where data strings containing % characters could be
corrupted by the DB-&gt;verify method. [#2427]
<li>Fix a bug where the DB_TRUNCATE flag could trigger a program error
if the database type was not specified. [#2423]
<li>Fix a bug in the Concurrent Data Store product where operations
could result in application hang or segmentation fault. [#2493]

</ol>
<h3>Btree Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where uninitialized parts of a database page could be read
and an incorrect record count returned.  [#2250]
<li>Fix a bug where reverse splits could corrupt a page under rare
conditions. [#2362]
<li>Fix a bug where cursors in the parent of a nested transaction could
be incorrectly adjusted after a child transaction was aborted. [#2373]
<li>Fix a bug where threads could race when updating a tree. [#2402]
<li>Fix a bug where a lock was leaked by the DB-&gt;stat method. [#2418]
<li>Fix a bug where DB-&gt;put could fail when the data matched a
duplicate data item previously deleted using a still-open cursor. [#2451]
<li>Fix a bug where one abort path after a page allocation could leak
the page. [#2455]
<li>Fix a bug where recovering the operation of moving on-page duplicates
into their own tree could cause corruption. [#2459]
<li>Fix a bug where moving on-page duplicates into their own tree could
cause cursors on the same page to reference an invalid key/data pair.  [#2462]
<li>Fix a bug where an error could be ignored when reverse splitting
the tree. [#2472]
<li>Fix a bug where creating Btrees deeper than 5 levels could cause
core dumps or out-of-memory errors.  [#2514]
<li>Fix a bug where the DB-&gt;verify method did not correctly diagnose
Btree/Recno internal page references to invalid pages. [#2525]

</ol>
<h3>Hash Access Method Changes:</h3>

<blockquote>None.</blockquote>

<h3>Queue Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where undo could happen incorrectly for record insert and
delete. [#2298]
<li>Fix a bug where a page could be leaked during Queue recovery. [#2431]

</ol>
<h3>Recno Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where the delete flag was set incorrectly in renumbering
Recno trees. [#2490]

</ol>
<h3>C++ API Changes:</h3>

<blockquote>None.</blockquote>

<h3>Java API Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where the wrong classname was used to find the fieldId in
storing back the DbEnv.private_dbobj field. [#1628]
<li>Fix a Java documentation bug, the com.sleepycat.examples.AccessExample
program removes the database so information from previous runs is not
available. [#2385]
<li>Fix a Java documentation bug, Db.del should show it returning int.
[#2480]
<li>Fix a bug where the Java Db.del API would fail to return
Db.DB_NOTFOUND [#2480]
<li>Fix a bug where the Db.DB_THREAD flag wasn't always set by Java. [#2492]

</ol>
<h3>Tcl API Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT was specified for the Tcl
command -use_environ. [#2400]

<blockquote>None.</blockquote>

<h3>XA Resource Manager Changes:</h3>

<h3>Locking Subsystem Changes:</h3>

<h3>Logging Subsystem Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where the underlying operating system sync interface could
be unnecessarily (and repeatedly) called when performing transaction
checkpoints. [#2287]
<li>Fix a bug where a recovery diagnostic message displayed the wrong
information. [#2449]

</ol>
<h3>Buffer Pool Subsystem Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where calling memp_sync (including by transaction checkpoint)
could cause shared region corruption and core dumps. [#2348, #2392]

</ol>
<h3>Transaction Subsystem Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where recovery would succeed but drop core if no close
record was ever written after the commit of a remove. [#2316]
<li>Fix a bug where file ID mapping could be incorrect [#2324]
<li>Fix a memory leak in abort of a nested transaction. [#2440]
<li>Fix a freed memory reference when committing active child transactions
during parent transaction commit. [#2457]

</ol>
<h3>Utility Changes:</h3>

<blockquote>None.</blockquote>

<h3>Configuration, Documentation, Portability and Build Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Portability fixes to compile on SunOS 4.1.4. [#2309]
<li>Fix a bug where VxWorks hash databases could be corrupted on dosFS
filesystems because Berkeley DB did not correct for dirty filesystem
reads. [#2317]

the correct filenames. [#2501]

DbEnv class constructor documentation. [#2510]
<li>Fix a bug where the DbEnv-&gt;set_server interface was not documented
