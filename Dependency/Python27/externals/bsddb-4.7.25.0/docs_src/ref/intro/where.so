    Where does m4_db run?,, intro/distrib, intro/products)

m4_p([dnl
m4_db requires only underlying m4_posix1_name system calls and can be
ported easily to new architectures by adding stub routines to connect
the native system interfaces to the m4_db POSIX-style system calls.
See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/distrib/port, Porting m4_db to new
architectures) for more information.])

m4_p([dnl
m4_db will autoconfigure and run on almost any modern UNIX, POSIX or
Linux systems, and on most historical UNIX platforms.  m4_db will
autoconfigure and run on almost any GNU gcc toolchain-based embedded
platform, including Cygwin, OpenLinux and others.  See
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/intro, Building for UNIX systems) for
more information.])
