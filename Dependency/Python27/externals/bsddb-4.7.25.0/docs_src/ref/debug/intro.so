m4_ref_title(Debugging Applications,
    Introduction to debugging,
    introduction to @debugging, install/multiple, debug/compile)

m4_p([dnl
Because m4_db is an embedded library, debugging applications that use
m4_db is both harder and easier than debugging a separate server.
Debugging can be harder because when a problem arises, it is not always
readily apparent whether the problem is in the application, is in the
database library, or is a result of an unexpected interaction between
the two.  Debugging can be easier because it is easier to track down a
problem when you can review a stack trace rather than deciphering
interprocess communication messages.  This chapter is intended to assist
you with debugging applications and reporting bugs to us so that we can
provide you with the correct answer or fix as quickly as possible.])

m4_p([dnl
When you encounter a problem, there are a few general actions you can
take:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag([Review the m4_db error output:], [m4_p([dnl
If an error output mechanism has been configured in the m4_db
environment, additional run-time error messages are made available to
the applications.  If you are not using an environment, it is well worth
modifying your application to create one so that you can get more
detailed error messages.  See m4_link(runtime, Run-time error
information) for more information on configuring m4_db to output these
error messages.])])

m4_tag([Review m4_ref(dbenv_set_verbose):], [m4_p([dnl
Check the list of flags for the m4_ref(dbenv_set_verbose) function, and
see if any of them will produce additional information that might help
understand the problem.])])

m4_tag([Add run-time diagnostics:], [m4_p([dnl
You can configure and build m4_db to perform run-time diagnostics.  (By
default, these checks are not done because they can seriously impact
performance.)  See m4_link(compile, Compile-time configuration) for more
information.])])

m4_tag([Apply all available patches:], [m4_p([dnl
Before reporting a problem in m4_db, please upgrade to the latest m4_db
release, if possible, or at least make sure you have applied any updates
available for your release from the
m4_linkweb(http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/db/index.html, m4_db web site).])])

m4_tag([Run the test suite:], [m4_p([dnl
If you see repeated failures or failures of simple test cases, run the
m4_db test suite to determine whether the distribution of m4_db you are
using was built and configured correctly.])])
