    Release 4.7: Run-time configuration,,
    upgrade.4.7/intro, upgrade.4.7/repapi)

m4_p([dnl
In historic m4_db releases, there were separate sleep and yield
functions to be configured at run-time using the db_env_set_func_sleep
and m4_ref(dbenv_set_func_yield) functions.  These functions have been
merged in the m4_db 4.7 release.  The replacement function should always
yield the processor, and optionally wait for some period of time before
allowing the thread to run again.])

m4_p([dnl
Applications using the m4_db run-time configuration interfaces should
merge the functionality of their sleep and yield functions into a single
configuration function.])

m4_p([dnl
In the 4.7 m4_db release, the db_env_set_func_map  and
db_env_set_func_unmap functions have been replaced.  This change fixes
problems where applications using the m4_db run-time configuration
interfaces could not open multiple m4_ref(DbEnv) handles for the same
database environment in a single application or join existing database
environments from within multiple processes.])

m4_p([dnl
Applications wanting to replace the m4_db region creation functionality
should replace their db_env_set_func_map and db_env_set_func_unmap calls
with a call to the m4_ref(dbenv_set_func_region_map) function.
Applications wanting to replace the m4_db region file mapping functionality
should replace their db_env_set_func_map and db_env_set_func_unmap calls
with a call to the m4_ref(dbenv_set_func_file_map) function.])
