m4_p([dnl
The m4_db Tcl API does not attempt to avoid evaluating input as Tcl
commands. For this reason, it may be dangerous to pass unreviewed user
input through the m4_db Tcl API, as the input may subsequently be
evaluated as a Tcl command.  To minimize the effectiveness of a Tcl
injection attack, the m4_db Tcl API in the 4.7 release routine resets
process' effective user and group IDs to the real user and group IDs.])
