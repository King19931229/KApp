m4_p([dnl
The __m4_product_name test suite is built if you specify
m4_linkpage(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/conf, --enable-test, --enable-test)
as an argument when configuring __m4_product_name.  The test suite also
requires that you configure and build the Tcl interface to the
library.])

m4_p([dnl
Before running the tests for the first time, you may need to edit the
m4_path(include.tcl) file in your build directory.  The
__m4_product_name configuration assumes that you intend to use the
version of the tclsh utility included in the Tcl installation with which
__m4_product_name was configured to run the test suite, and further
assumes that the test suite will be run with the libraries prebuilt in
the __m4_product_name build directory.  If either of these assumptions
are incorrect, you will need to edit the m4_path(include.tcl) file and
change the following line to correctly specify the full path to the
version of tclsh with which you are going to run the test suite:])

m4_indent([set tclsh_path ...])

m4_p([dnl
You may also need to change the following line to correctly specify the
path from the directory where you are running the test suite to the
location of the __m4_product_name Tcl library you built:])

m4_indent([set test_path ...])

m4_p([dnl
It may not be necessary that this be a full path if you have configured
your system's shared library mechanisms to search the directory where
you built or installed the Tcl library.])

m4_p([dnl
All __m4_product_name tests are run from within m4_bold(tclsh).  After
starting tclsh, you must source the file m4_path(test.tcl) in the test
directory.  For example, if you built in the m4_path(build_unix)
directory of the distribution, this would be done using the following
command:])

m4_indent([% source ../test/test.tcl])

m4_p([dnl
If no errors occur, you should get a "%" prompt.])

m4_p([dnl
You are now ready to run tests in the test suite; see
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/test/run, Running the test suite) for more
information.])
