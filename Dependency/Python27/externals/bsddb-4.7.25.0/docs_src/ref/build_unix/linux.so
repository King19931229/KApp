Special compile-time flags are required when compiling threaded
applications on Linux.  If you are compiling a threaded application, you
must compile with the _REENTRANT flag:])

Some Linux filesystems do not support POSIX filesystem semantics.
Specifically, ext2 and early releases of ReiserFS, and ext3 in some
configurations, do not support "ordered data mode" and may insert random
data into database or log files when systems crash.  m4_db files should
not be placed on a filesystem that does not support, or is not
configured to support, POSIX semantics.])])

m4_p([dnl
In some Linux kernels you can select schedulers, and the default is the
"anticipatory" scheduler.  We recommend not using the "anticipatory"
scheduler for transaction processing workloads.])])
