Special compile-time flags are required when compiling threaded
applications on FreeBSD.  If you are compiling a threaded application,
you must compile with the _THREAD_SAFE and -pthread flags:])

There is a known bug in the XDR implementation in the FreeBSD C library
from version 2.2 up to version 4.0-RELEASE, that causes certain-sized
messages to fail and return a zero-filled reply to the client.  A bug
report (#16028) has been filed with FreeBSD.  The following patch is the
FreeBSD fix:])

Some FreeBSD releases are known to return ENOLCK from fsync and close
calls on NFS-mounted filesystems, even though the call has succeeded.
The m4_db code should be modified to ignore ENOLCK errors, or no m4_db
files should be placed on NFS-mounted filesystems on these systems.])])
