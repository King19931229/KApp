    Introduction to the logging subsystem,

m4_p([dnl
The Logging subsystem is the logging facility used by m4_db.  It is
largely m4_db-specific, although it is potentially useful outside of
the m4_db package for applications wanting write-ahead logging support.
Applications wanting to use the log for purposes other than logging file
modifications based on a set of open file descriptors will almost
certainly need to make source code modifications to the m4_db code
base.])

m4_p([dnl
A log can be shared by any number of threads of control.  The
m4_refT(dbenv_open) is used to open a log.  When the log is no longer
in use, it should be closed using the m4_refT(dbenv_close).])

m4_p([dnl
Individual log entries are identified by log sequence numbers.  Log
sequence numbers are stored in an opaque object, a m4_ref(DbLsn).])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(log_cursor) is used to allocate a log cursor.  Log cursors
have two methods: m4_refT(logc_get) to retrieve log records from the
log, and m4_refT(logc_close) to destroy the cursor.])

m4_p([dnl
There are additional methods for integrating the log subsystem with a
transaction processing system:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(m4_ref(log_flush), [dnl
Flushes the log up to a particular log sequence number.])

m4_tag(m4_ref(log_compare), [dnl
Allows applications to compare any two log sequence numbers.])

m4_tag([m4_ref(log_file)   ], [dnl
Maps a log sequence number to the specific log file that contains it.])

m4_tag(m4_ref(log_archive), [dnl
Returns various sets of log filenames.  These methods are used for
database administration; for example, to determine if log files may
safely be removed from the system.])

m4_tag([m4_ref(log_stat)   ], [dnl
The display m4_ref(db_stat) utility uses the m4_refT(log_stat) to
display statistics about the log.])

m4_tag(m4_ref(dbenv_remove), [dnl
The log meta-information (but not the log files themselves) may be
removed using the m4_refT(dbenv_remove).])
