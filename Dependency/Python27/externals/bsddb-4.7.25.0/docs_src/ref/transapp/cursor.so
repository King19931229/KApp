m4_db cursors may be used inside a transaction, exactly as any other
m4_ref(Db) method.  The enclosing transaction ID must be specified when
the cursor is created, but it does not then need to be further specified
on operations performed using the cursor.  One important point to
remember is that a cursor m4_bold([must be closed]) before the enclosing
transaction is committed or aborted.])

m4_p([dnl
The following code fragment uses a cursor to store a new key in the cats
database with four associated data items.  The key is a name.  The data
items are a company name and a list of the breeds of cat owned.  Each
of the data entries is stored as a duplicate data item.  In this
example, transactions are necessary to ensure that either all or none
of the data items appear in case of system or application failure.])
