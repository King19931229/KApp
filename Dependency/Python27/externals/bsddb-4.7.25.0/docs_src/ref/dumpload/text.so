m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(db_load) utility can be used to load text into databases.
The m4_option(T) option permits nondatabase applications to create
flat-text files that are then loaded into databases for fast,
highly-concurrent access.  For example, the following command loads the
standard UNIX m4_path(/etc/passwd) file into a database, with the login
name as the key item and the entire password entry as the data item:])

	sed 's/m4_backslash([])m4_backslash([])/m4_backslash([])m4_backslash([])m4_backslash([])m4_backslash([])/g' | db_load -T -t hash passwd.db])

m4_p([dnl
Note that backslash characters naturally occurring in the text are escaped
to avoid interpretation as escape characters by m4_ref(db_load).])
