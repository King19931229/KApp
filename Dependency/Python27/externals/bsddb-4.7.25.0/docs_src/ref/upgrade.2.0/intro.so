The following pages describe how to upgrade applications coded against
the m4_db 1.85 and 1.86 release interfaces to the m4_db 2.0 release
interfaces.  They do not describe how to upgrade to the current m4_db
release interfaces.])

m4_p([dnl
It is not difficult to upgrade m4_db 1.85 applications to use the m4_db
version 2 library.  The m4_db version 2 library has a m4_db 1.85
compatibility API, which you can use by either recompiling your
application's source code or by relinking its object files against the
version 2 library.  The underlying databases must be converted, however,
as the m4_db version 2 library has a different underlying database format.])
