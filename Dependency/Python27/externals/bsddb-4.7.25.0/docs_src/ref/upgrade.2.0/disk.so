You will need to upgrade your on-disk databases, as all access method
database formats changed in the m4_db 2.0 release.  For information on
converting databases from m4_db 1.85 to m4_db 2.0, see the
m4_ref(db_dump185) and m4_ref(db_load) documentation.  As database
environments did not exist prior to the 2.0 release, there is no
question of upgrading existing database environments.])
