m4_p([dnl
In previous releases, m4_db UNIX used the --disable-bigfile configuration
option for systems that could not, for whatever reason, include large
file support in a particular m4_db configuration.  However, large file
support has been integrated into the autoconf configuration tool as of
version 2.50. For that reason, m4_db configuration no longer supports
--disable-bigfile, the autoconf standard --disable-largefile should be
used instead.])
