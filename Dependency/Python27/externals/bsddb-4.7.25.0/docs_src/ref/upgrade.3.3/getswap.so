m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(dbh_get_byteswapped) method can return an error in the m4_db
3.3 release, and so requires an interface change.  C and C++
applications calling m4_ref(dbh_get_byteswapped) should be changed to
treat the method's return as an error code, and to pass an additional
second argument of type m4_bold(int *) to the method.  The additional
argument is used as a memory location in which to store the requested
information.])
