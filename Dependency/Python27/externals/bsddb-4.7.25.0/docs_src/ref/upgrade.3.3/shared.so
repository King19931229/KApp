m4_p([dnl
In previous releases, m4_db required separate configuration and builds
to create both static and shared libraries.  This has changed in the
3.3 release, and m4_db now builds and installs both shared and static
versions of the m4_db libraries by default.  This change was based on
m4_db upgrading to release 1.4 of the GNU Project's Libtool distribution.
For this reason, m4_db no longer supports the previous --enable-dynamic
and --enable-shared configuration options.  Instead, as m4_db now builds
both static and shared libraries by default, the useful options are
Libtool's --disable-shared and --disable-static options.])
