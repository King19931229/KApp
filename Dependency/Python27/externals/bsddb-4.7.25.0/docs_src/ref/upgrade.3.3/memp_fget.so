    [Release 3.3: memp_fget, EIO],,
    upgrade.3.3/conflict, upgrade.3.3/txn_prepare)

m4_p([dnl
Previous releases of m4_db returned the system error EIO when the
memp_fget function was called to retrieve a page, the page did not
exist, and the m4_ref(DB_MPOOL_CREATE) flag was not set.  In the 3.3
release, the error m4_ref(DB_PAGE_NOTFOUND) is returned instead, to
allow applications to distinguish between recoverable and
non-recoverable errors.  Applications calling the memp_fget function
and checking for a return of EIO should check for
m4_ref(DB_PAGE_NOTFOUND) instead.])

m4_p([dnl
Previous releases of m4_db treated filesystem I/O failure (the most
common of which the filesystem running out of space), as a fatal error,
returning m4_ref(DB_RUNRECOVERY).  When a filesystem failure happens in
the 3.3 release m4_db returns the underlying system error (usually EIO),
but can continue to run.  Applications should abort any enclosing
transaction when a recoverable system error occurs in order to recover
from the error.])
