m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(dbh_get_type) method can return an error in the m4_db 3.3
release, and so requires an interface change.  C and C++ applications
calling m4_ref(dbh_get_type) should be changed to treat the method's
return as an error code, and to pass an additional second argument of
type m4_bold(DBTYPE *) to the method.  The additional argument is used
as a memory location in which to store the requested information.])
