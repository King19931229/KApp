m4_p([dnl
Starting with the 3.1 release of m4_db, the m4_ref(dbenv_set_feedback)
and m4_refT(dbh_set_feedback)s may return an error value, that is, they
are no longer declared as returning no value, instead they return an int
or throw an exception as appropriate when an error occurs.])

m4_p([dnl
If your application calls these functions, you may want to check for a
possible error on return.])
