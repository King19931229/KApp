m4_p([dnl
Starting with the 3.1 release of m4_db, the DB_ENV-__GT__set_paniccall
and DB-__GT__set_paniccall methods may return an error value, that is,
they are no longer declared as returning no value, instead they return
an int or throw an exception as appropriate when an error occurs.])

m4_p([dnl
If your application calls these functions, you may want to check for a
possible error on return.])
