m4_p([dnl
On Win/32 platforms m4_db no longer pre-allocates log files.  The problem
was a noticeable performance spike as each log file was created.  To turn
this feature back on, search for the flag DB_OSO_LOG in the source file
m4_path(log/log_put.c) and make the change described there, or contact
us for assistance.])
