    Release 3.1: Tcl API,, upgrade.3.1/env, upgrade.3.1/tmp)

m4_p([dnl
The m4_db Tcl API has been modified so that the m4_arg(-mpool) option to
the m4_bold(berkdb env) command is now the default behavior.  The Tcl API
has also been modified so that the m4_arg(-txn) option to the
m4_bold(berkdb env) command implies the m4_arg(-lock) and m4_arg(-log)
options.  Tcl scripts should be updated to remove the m4_arg(-mpool),
m4_arg(-lock) and m4_arg(-log) options.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_db Tcl API has been modified to follow the Tcl standard rules
for integer conversion, for example, if the first two characters of a
record number are "0x", the record number is expected to be in
hexadecimal form.])
