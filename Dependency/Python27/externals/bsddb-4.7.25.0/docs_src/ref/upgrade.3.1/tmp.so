    Release 3.1: DB_TMP_DIR,, upgrade.3.1/tcl, upgrade.3.1/logalloc)

m4_p([dnl
This change only affects Win/32 applications that create in-memory
databases.])

m4_p([dnl
On Win/32 platforms an additional test has been added when searching for
the appropriate directory in which to create the temporary files that are
used to back in-memory databases.  m4_db now uses any return value from
the GetTempPath interface as the temporary file directory name before
resorting to the static list of compiled-in pathnames.])

m4_p([dnl
If the system registry does not return the same directory as m4_db has
been using previously, this change could cause temporary backing files to
move to a new directory when applications are upgraded to the 3.1 release.
In extreme cases, this could create (or fix) security problems if the file
protection modes for the system registry directory are different from
those on the directory previously used by m4_db.])
