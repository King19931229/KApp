m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Release 3.1: identical duplicate data items,,
    upgrade.3.1/put, upgrade.3.1/btstat)

m4_p([dnl
In previous releases of m4_db, it was not an error to store identical
duplicate data items, or, for those that just like the way it sounds,
duplicate duplicates.  However, there were implementation bugs where
storing duplicate duplicates could cause database corruption.])

m4_p([dnl
In this release, applications may store identical duplicate data items
as long as the data items are unsorted.  It is an error to attempt to
store identical duplicate data items when duplicates are being stored
in a sorted order. This restriction is expected to be lifted in a future
release.  See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am_conf/dup, Duplicate data items)
for more information.])
