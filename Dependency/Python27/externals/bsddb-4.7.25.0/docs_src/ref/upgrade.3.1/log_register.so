The arguments to the log_register and log_unregister interfaces have
changed.  Instead of returning (and passing in) a logging file ID, a
reference to the m4_ref(Db) structure being registered (or unregistered)
is passed.  The application should be searched for any occurrences of
log_register and log_unregister.  For each one, change the arguments to
be a reference to the m4_ref(Db) structure being registered or
unregistered.])
