For Btree database statistics, the m4_refT(dbh_stat) field
m4_arg(bt_nrecs) has been removed, replaced by two fields:
m4_arg(bt_nkeys) and m4_arg(bt_ndata).  The m4_arg(bt_nkeys) field returns
a count of the unique keys in the database.  The m4_arg(bt_ndata) field
returns a count of the key/data pairs in the database.  Neither exactly
matches the previous value of the m4_arg(bt_nrecs) field, which returned
a count of keys in the database, but, in the case of Btree databases,
could overcount as it sometimes counted duplicate data items as unique
keys.  The application should be searched for any uses of the
m4_arg(bt_nrecs) field and the field should be changed to be either
m4_arg(bt_nkeys) or m4_arg(bt_ndata), whichever is more appropriate.])

For Hash database statistics, the m4_refT(dbh_stat) field
m4_arg(hash_nrecs) has been removed, replaced by two fields:
m4_arg(hash_nkeys) and m4_arg(hash_ndata).  The m4_arg(hash_nkeys) field
returns a count of the unique keys in the database.  The
m4_arg(hash_ndata) field returns a count of the key/data pairs in the
database.  The new m4_arg(hash_nkeys) field exactly matches the previous
value of the m4_arg(hash_nrecs) field.  The application should be
searched for any uses of the m4_arg(hash_nrecs) field, and the field
should be changed to be m4_arg(hash_nkeys).])

For Queue database statistics, the m4_refT(dbh_stat) field
m4_arg(qs_nrecs) has been removed, replaced by two fields:
m4_arg(qs_nkeys) and m4_arg(qs_ndata).  The m4_arg(qs_nkeys) field returns
a count of the unique keys in the database.  The m4_arg(qs_ndata) field
returns a count of the key/data pairs in the database.  The new
m4_arg(qs_nkeys) field exactly matches the previous value of the
m4_arg(qs_nrecs) field.  The application should be searched for any uses
of the m4_arg(qs_nrecs) field, and the field should be changed to be
m4_arg(qs_nkeys).])
