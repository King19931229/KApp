m4_p([dnl
An additional argument has been added to the m4_arg(pgin) and
m4_arg(pgout) functions provided to the memp_register function.
The application should be searched for any occurrences of
memp_register.  For each one, if m4_arg(pgin) or m4_arg(pgout)
functions are specified, the m4_arg(pgin) and m4_arg(pgout) functions
should be modified to take an initial argument of a m4_arg(DB_ENV *).
This argument is intended to support better error reporting for
applications, and may be entirely ignored by the m4_arg(pgin) and
m4_arg(pgout) functions themselves.])
