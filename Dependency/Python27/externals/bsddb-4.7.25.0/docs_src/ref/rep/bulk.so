    Bulk transfer,, rep/init, rep/trans)

m4_p([dnl
Sites in a replication group may be configured to use bulk transfer by
calling the m4_refT(rep_set_config) with the m4_ref(DB_REP_CONF_BULK)
flag.  When configured for bulk transfer, sites will accumulate records
in a buffer and transfer them to another site in a single network
transfer.  Configuring bulk transfer makes sense for master sites, of
course.  Additionally, applications using client-to-client
synchronization may find it helpful to configure bulk transfer for
client sites as well.])

m4_p([dnl
When a master is generating new log records, or any information request
is made of a master, and bulk transfer has been configured, records will
accumulate in a bulk buffer.  The bulk buffer will be sent to the client
if either the buffer is full or if a permanent record (for example, a
transaction commit or checkpoint record) is queued for the client.])

m4_p([dnl
When a client is responding to another client's request for information,
and bulk transfer has been configured, records will accumulate in a bulk
buffer.  The bulk buffer will be sent to the client when the buffer is
full or when the client's request has been satisfied; no particular type
of record will cause the buffer to be sent.])

m4_p([dnl
The size of the bulk buffer itself is internally determined and cannot
be configured.  However, the overall size of a transfer may be limited
using the m4_refT(rep_set_limit).])
