In the case of nested transactions, if the transaction is a parent
transaction, committing the parent transaction causes all unresolved
children of the parent to be committed.  In the case of nested
transactions, if the transaction is a child transaction, its locks are
not released, but are acquired by its parent.  Although the commit of the
child transaction will succeed, the actual resolution of the child
transaction is postponed until the parent transaction is committed or
aborted; that is, if its parent transaction commits, it will be
committed; and if its parent transaction aborts, it will be aborted.])

transaction is committed.])
