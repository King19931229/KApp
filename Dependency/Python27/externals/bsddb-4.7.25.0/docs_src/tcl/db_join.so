m4_p([dnl
The m4_tcl_db_join command joins the specified cursors and returns a
cursor handle that can be used to iterate through the joined {key data}
pairs.  The returned cursor handle is bound to a Tcl command of the form
m4_bold(dbN.cX), where X is an integer starting at 0 (for example,
db0.c0 and db0.c1).  It is through this Tcl command that the script
accesses the cursor methods.])

m4_p([dnl
The returned join cursor has limited cursor functionality, and only the
m4_tcl_dbc_get and m4_tcl_dbc_close commands will succeed.])

m4_p([dnl
See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am/join, Equality join) for more information on
the underlying requirements for joining.])

m4_p([dnl
In a transaction-protected environment, all the cursors listed must have
been created within the same transaction.])
