Remove a m4_db environment.])

The options are as follows:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag([-data_dir dirname], [dnl
Specify the environment's data directory, as described in
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/naming, [m4_db File Naming]).])

m4_tag([-force], [dnl
If there are processes that have called m4_tcl_env_open without calling
m4_tcl_env_close (that is, there are processes currently using the
environment), m4_tcl_env_remove will fail without further action, unless
the m4_arg(-force) flag is set, in which case m4_tcl_env_remove will
attempt to remove the environment regardless of any processes still
using it.])

m4_tag([-home directory], [dnl
The m4_arg(-home) argument is described in
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/naming, [m4_db File Naming]).])

m4_tag([-log_dir dirname], [dnl
Specify the environment's log directory, as described in
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/naming, [m4_db File Naming]).])

m4_tag([-tmp_dir dirname], [dnl
Specify the environment's tmp directory, as described in
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/naming, [m4_db File Naming]).])
