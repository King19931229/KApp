m4_p([dnl
The m4_tcl_txn_abort command causes an abnormal termination of the
transaction.])

m4_p([dnl
The log is played backward, and any necessary recovery operations are
performed.  After recovery is completed, all locks held by the
transaction are acquired by the parent transaction in the case of a
nested transaction, or released in the case of a non-nested transaction.
As is the case for m4_tcl_txn_commit, applications that require strict
two-phase locking should not explicitly release any locks.])

m4_p([dnl
In the case of nested transactions, aborting the parent transaction
causes all children of that transaction to be aborted.])

m4_p([dnl
After m4_tcl_txn_abort has been called, regardless of its return, the
m4_arg(txn) handle may not be accessed again.])
