m4_p([dnl
The m4_tcl_dbc_dup command duplicates the cursor, creates a new cursor
that uses the same transaction and locker ID as the original cursor. This
is useful when an application is using locking and requires two or more
cursors in the same thread of control.])

m4_p([dnl
The options are as follows:])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tag([-position], [dnl
The newly created cursor is initialized to refer to the same position
in the database as the original cursor and hold the same locks. If the
m4_arg(-position) flag is not specified, the created cursor is
uninitialized and will behave like a cursor newly created using the
m4_tcl_db_cursor command.])
