m4_p([dnl
The m4_tcl_db_get command returns key/data pairs from the database.])

m4_p([dnl
In the presence of duplicate key values, m4_tcl_db_get will return all
duplicate items.  Duplicates are sorted by insert order except where this
order has been overridden by cursor operations.])

m4_p([dnl
The options are as follows:])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tag([-consume], [dnl
Return the record number and data from the available record closest to
the head of the queue, and delete the record. The cursor will be
positioned on the deleted record.  A record is available if it is not
deleted and is not currently locked.  The underlying database must be
of type Queue for m4_arg(-consume) to be specified.])

m4_tag([-consume_wait], [dnl
The same as the m4_arg(-consume) flag except that if the Queue database
is empty, the thread of control will wait until there is data in the
queue before returning.  The underlying database must be of type Queue
for m4_arg(-consume_wait) to be specified.])

m4_tag([-get_both key data], [dnl
Retrieve the key/data pair only if both the key and data match the
arguments.])

m4_tag([-glob], [dnl
Return all keys matching the given key, where the key is a simple
wildcard pattern.  Where it is used, it replaces the use of the key with
the given pattern of a set of keys.  Any characters after the wildcard
character are ignored.  For example, in a database of last names, the
command "db0 get Jones" will return all occurrences of "Jones" in the
database, and the command "db0 get -glob Jo*" will return both "Jones"
and "Johnson" from the database.  The command "db0 get -glob *" will
return all of the key/data pairs in the database.
This option only works on databases using the Btree access method.])

m4_tag([-partial {doff dlen}], [dnl
The m4_arg(dlen) bytes starting m4_arg(doff) bytes from the beginning
of the retrieved data record are returned as if they comprised the
entire record. If any or all of the specified bytes do not exist in the
record, the command is successful and any existing bytes are returned.])

m4_tag([-recno], [dnl
Retrieve the specified numbered key/data pair from a database.  For
m4_arg(-recno) to be specified, the specified key must be a record
number; and the underlying database must be of type Recno or Queue, or
of type Btree that was created with the m4_arg(-recnum) option.])

m4_tag([-rmw], [dnl
Acquire write locks instead of read locks when doing the retrieval.
Setting this flag may decrease the likelihood of deadlock during a
read-modify-write cycle by immediately acquiring the write lock during
the read part of the cycle so that another thread of control acquiring a
read lock for the same item, in its own read-modify-write cycle, will not
result in deadlock.
m4_p([dnl
Because the m4_tcl_db_get command will not hold locks across m4_db
interface calls in nontransactional environments, the m4_arg(-rmw)
argument to the m4_tcl_db_get call is only meaningful in the presence
of transactions.])])

m4_tcl_txnopt

m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
If the underlying database is a Queue or Recno database, the given key
will be interpreted by Tcl as an integer.  For all other database types,
the key is interpreted by Tcl as a byte array, unless indicated by a
given option.])

m4_p([dnl
A list of key/data pairs is returned.  In the error case that no matching
key exists, an empty list is returned.  In all other cases, a Tcl error
is thrown.])
