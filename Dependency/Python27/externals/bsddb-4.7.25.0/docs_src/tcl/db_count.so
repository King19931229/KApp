The m4_tcl_db_count command returns a count of the number of duplicate
data items for the key given.  If the key does not exist, a value of 0
is returned.  If there are no duplicates, or if the database does not
support duplicates, but a key/data pair exists, a value of 1 is
returned.  If an error occurs, a m4_db error message is returned or a
Tcl error is thrown.])
