m4_p([dnl
The m4_tcl_db_is_byteswapped command returns 0 if the underlying
database files were created on an architecture of the same byte order
as the current one, and 1 if they were not (that is, big-endian on a
little-endian machine, or vice versa). This information may be used to
determine if application data needs to be adjusted for this architecture
or not.])
