m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(Dbc) object is the handle for a cursor into a m4_db database.
The handle is not free-threaded.  Cursor handles may be used by multiple
threads, but only serially, that is, the application must serialize
access to the m4_ref(Dbc) handle.])

m4_p([dnl
If the cursor is to be used to perform operations on behalf of a
transaction, the cursor must be opened and closed within the context of
that single transaction.  Once m4_ref(dbc_close) has been called, the
handle may not be accessed again, regardless of the method's return.])
