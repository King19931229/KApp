The m4_ref(db_upgrade) utility upgrades the m4_db version of one or more
files and the databases they contain to the current release version.])

This flag is only meaningful when upgrading databases from releases
before the m4_db 3.1 release.
m4_p([dnl
As part of the upgrade from the m4_db 3.0 release to the 3.1 release,
the on-disk format of duplicate data items changed. To correctly upgrade
the format requires that applications specify whether duplicate data
items in the database are sorted or not. Specifying the m4_option(s)
flag means that the duplicates are sorted; otherwise, they are assumed
to be unsorted.  Incorrectly specifying the value of this flag may lead
to database corruption.])
m4_p([dnl
Because the m4_ref(db_upgrade) utility upgrades a physical file
(including all the databases it contains), it is not possible to use
m4_ref(db_upgrade) to upgrade files where some of the databases it
includes have sorted duplicate data items, and some of the databases it
includes have unsorted duplicate data items. If the file does not have
more than a single database, if the databases do not support duplicate
data items, or if all the databases that support duplicate data items
support the same style of duplicates (either sorted or unsorted),
m4_ref(db_upgrade) will work correctly as long as the m4_option(s) flag
is correctly specified. Otherwise, the file cannot be upgraded using
m4_ref(db_upgrade), and must be upgraded manually using the
m4_ref(db_dump) and m4_ref(db_load) utilities.])])

m4_bold([It is important to realize that m4_db database upgrades are done
in place, and so are potentially destructive.]) This means that if the
system crashes during the upgrade procedure, or if the upgrade procedure
runs out of disk space, the databases may be left in an inconsistent and
unrecoverable state.  See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am/upgrade, [Upgrading
databases]) for more information.])
