This information describes the m4_ref(DbRunRecoveryException) class and
how it is used by the various m4_db classes.])

m4_p([dnl
Errors can occur in the m4_db library where the only solution is to shut
down the application and run recovery (for example, if m4_db is unable
to allocate heap memory).  When a fatal error occurs in m4_db, methods
will throw a m4_ref(DbRunRecoveryException), at which point all
subsequent m4_db calls will also fail in the same way.  When this
occurs, recovery should be performed.])
m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(DbException) errno value is set to DB_RUNRECOVERY.])
