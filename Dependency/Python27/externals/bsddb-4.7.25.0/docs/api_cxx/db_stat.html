<b>Description: Db::stat</b>
<p>The Db::stat method creates a statistical structure and copies a
pointer to it into user-specified memory locations.  Specifically, if
<b>sp</b> is non-NULL, a pointer to the statistics for the database are
copied into the memory location to which it refers.</p>
<b>Parameters</b> <br>
 <b>flags</b><ul compact><li>The <b>flags</b> parameter must be set to 0 or
one of the following values:
<br>
<b><a name="DB_FAST_STAT">DB_FAST_STAT</a></b><ul compact><li>Return only the values which do not require traversal of the database.
Among other things, this flag makes it possible for applications to
request key and record counts without incurring the performance penalty
of traversing the entire database.</ul>
<b><a name="DB_READ_COMMITTED">DB_READ_COMMITTED</a></b><ul compact><li>Database items read during a transactional call will have degree 2
isolation.  This ensures the stability of the data items read during the
stat operation but permits that data to be modified or deleted by other
transactions prior to the commit of the specified transaction.</ul>
<b><a name="DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a></b><ul compact><li>Database items read during a transactional call will have degree 1
isolation, including modified but not yet committed data.  Silently
ignored if the <a href="../api_cxx/db_open.html#DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a> flag was not specified when
the underlying database was opened.</ul> <br></ul>
 <b>txnid</b><ul compact><li>If the operation is part of an application-specified transaction, the
<b>txnid</b> parameter is a transaction handle returned from
<a href="../api_cxx/txn_begin.html">DbEnv::txn_begin</a>; if the operation is part of a Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store group, the
<b>txnid</b> parameter is a handle returned from
<a href="../api_cxx/env_cdsgroup_begin.html">DbEnv::cdsgroup_begin</a>; otherwise NULL.
If no transaction handle is
specified, but the
operation occurs in a transactional
database,
the operation will be implicitly transaction protected.
</ul>
<br>
<p>Statistical structures are stored in allocated memory.  If application-specific allocation
routines have been declared (see <a href="../api_cxx/env_set_alloc.html">DbEnv::set_alloc</a> for more
information), they are used to allocate the memory; otherwise, the
standard C library <b>malloc</b>(3) is used.  The caller is
responsible for deallocating the memory.  To deallocate the memory, free
the memory reference; references inside the returned memory need not be
individually freed.</p>
<p>If the DB_FAST_STAT flag has not been specified, the
Db::stat method will access some of or all the pages in the database,
incurring a severe performance penalty as well as possibly flushing the
underlying buffer pool.</p>
<p>In the presence of multiple threads or processes accessing an active
database, the information returned by Db::stat may be out-of-date.</p>
<p>If the database was not opened read-only and the DB_FAST_STAT
flag was not specified, the cached key and record numbers will be
updated after the statistical information has been gathered.</p>
<p>The Db::stat method may not be called before the <a href="../api_cxx/db_open.html">Db::open</a> method is called.</p>
<p>The Db::stat method
either returns a non-zero error value
or throws an exception that encapsulates a non-zero error value on
failure, and returns 0 on success.
</p>
<b>Hash Statistics</b>
<p>In the case of a Hash database, the statistics are stored in a structure
of type DB_HASH_STAT.  The following fields will be filled in:</p>
<br>
<b>u_int32_t hash_magic;</b><ul compact><li>Magic number that identifies the file as a Hash file.  Returned if
DB_FAST_STAT is set.</ul>

set.</ul>
<b>u_int32_t hash_nkeys;</b><ul compact><li>The number of unique keys in the database.  If DB_FAST_STAT was
specified the count will be the last saved value unless it has never
been calculated, in which case it will be 0. Returned if
DB_FAST_STAT is set.</ul>
<b>u_int32_t hash_ndata;</b><ul compact><li>The number of key/data pairs in the database.  If DB_FAST_STAT
was specified the count will be the last saved value unless it has never
been calculated, in which case it will be 0. Returned if

<b>u_int32_t hash_big_bfree;</b><ul compact><li>The number of bytes free on big item pages.</ul>

<b>Description: Db::stat_print</b>
<p>The Db::stat_print method displays the
database statistical information, as described for the Db::stat method.
The information is printed to a specified output channel (see the
<a href="../api_cxx/env_set_msgfile.html">DbEnv::set_msgfile</a> method for more information), or passed to an
application callback function (see the <a href="../api_cxx/env_set_msgcall.html">DbEnv::set_msgcall</a> method for

<p>The Db::stat_print method may not be called before the <a href="../api_cxx/db_open.html">Db::open</a> method is called.</p>
<p>The Db::stat_print method
either returns a non-zero error value
or throws an exception that encapsulates a non-zero error value on
failure, and returns 0 on success.
</p>
<b>Parameters</b> <br>
