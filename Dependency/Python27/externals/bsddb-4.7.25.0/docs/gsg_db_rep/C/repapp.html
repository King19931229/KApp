        The easiest way to add replication to your transactional
        application is to use the replication framework. The replication framework provides a comprehensive 
        communications layer that enables replication. For a brief listing
        of the replication framework's feature set, see 
        <a href="apioverview.html#repframeworkoverview">Replication Framework Overview</a>.
    </p>
      <p>
        To use the replication framework, you make use of special methods off the
        <span><tt class="classname">DB_ENV</tt> class.</span>
        
        That is: 
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                                    Create an environment handle as normal.
                            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                                    Configure your environment handle as
                                    needed (e.g. set the error file and
                                    error prefix values, if desired).
                            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                                    Use the replication framework replication methods to
                                    configure the replication framework. Using these
                                    methods causes DB to know that you
                                    are using the replication framework.
                            </p>
            <p>
                                    Configuring the replication framework 
                                    entails setting its replication
                                    priority, setting the TCP/IP address
                                    that this replication environment will use for
                                    incoming replication messages, identify
                                    TCP/IP addresses of other replication
                                    environments, setting the number of
                                    replication environments in the
                                    replication group, and so forth. These actions are
                                    discussed throughout the remainder of
                                    this chapter.

                                    Open your environment handle. When you
                                    do this, be sure to specify 

                                    <span><tt class="literal">DB_INIT_REP</tt> and
                                    <tt class="literal">DB_THREAD</tt> to your
                                    open flags. (This is in addition to the
                                    flags that you normally use for a
                                    single-threaded transactional
                                    application).  The first of these causes
                                    replication to be initialized for the
                                    application. The second causes your
                                    environment handle to be free-threaded
                                    (thread safe). Both flags are required
                                    for replication framework usage.

                                    and write activity. Replicas can open
                                    their databases for read-only activity, but
                                    doing so means they must re-open the
                                    databases if the replica ever becomes a
                                    master.  Either way, replicas should never attempt to
                                    write to the database(s) directly.

                            The replication framework allows you to only use one

                            Before you can use the replication framework, you may have to
                            enable it in your DB library. This is
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a requirement for
                            Microsoft Windows systems, or Unix systems that
                            use pthread mutexes by default. Other systems,
                            notably BSD and BSD-derived systems (such as
                            Mac OS X), must enable the replication framework when you
                            configure the DB build.
                    </p>
        <p>
                            You do this by <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
                            disabling replication and by configuring the
                            library with POSIX threads support. In other
                            words, replication must be turned on in the
                            build (it is by default), and POSIX thread
                            support must be enabled if it is not already by
                            default.  To do this, use the

                    As described above, you introduce replication to an
                    application by starting with a transactional
                    application, performing some basic replication
                    configuration, and then starting replication using 
                    <span><tt class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;repmgr_start()</tt>.</span>

        <p>
                    You stop replication by closing your environment

                For example, the following code fragment initializes, then
                stops and starts replication. Note that other replication

                    In the previous example, we specified

                                    participate in the vote. There is no

                                    As always, the environment participating in the election with the most
                                    up-to-date log files is selected as
                                    master. If an environment with better log files
                                    has not yet joined the replication
                                    group, it may not become the master.

                    Therefore, to give you a better degree of control over

                   The application starts up and declares itself to be a master
                   without calling for an election. It is an error for more
                   than one environment to start up using this flag, or for
                   an environment
                   to use this flag when a master already exists. 
                   </p>
                    <p>
                           Note that no replication group should

                    <p>
                           In the event that a environment attempts to become a
                           master when a master already exists, the
                           replication code will resolve the problem by
                           holding an election. Note, however, that there
                           is always a possibility of data loss in the face
                           of duplicate masters, because once a master is
                           selected, the environment that loses the election will
                           have to roll back any transactions committed
                           until it is in sync with the "real" master.

                                    incoming message thread, and it will
                                    then write the message to the socket.
                                    This prevents your database write
                                    threads from blocking due to abnormal
                                    network I/O conditions.

                                    Message processing threads are
                                    responsible for parsing and then
                                    responding to incoming replication
                                    messages. Typically, a response will
                                    include write activity to your
                                    database(s), so these threads can be
                                    busy performing disk I/O.

                    Of these threads, the only ones that you have any
                    configuration control over are the message processing
                    threads. In this case, you can determine how many
                    of these threads you want to run.

                    It is always a bit of an art to decide on a thread count,
                    but the short answer is you probably do not need more
                    than three threads here, and it is likely that one will
                    suffice. That said, the best thing to do is set your
                    thread count to a fairly low number and then increase
                    it if it appears that your application will benefit
                    from the additional threads.
