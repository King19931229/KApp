      <p>
                  Every environment participating in a replicated application
                  must know whether it is a <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> or
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>replica</em></span>. The reason for this is
                  because, simply, the master can modify the database while
                  replicas cannot. As a result, not only will you open
                  databases differently depended on whether the environment is
                  running as a master, but the environment will frequently
                  behave quit a bit differently depending on whether it
                  thinks it is operating as the read/write interface for
                  your database.
          </p>
      <p>
                  Moreover, an environment must also be capable of
                  gracefully switching between master and replica states.
                  This means that the environment must be able to detect when
                  it has switched states.
          </p>
      <p>
                  Not surprisingly, a large part of your application's code
                  will be tied up in knowing which state a given
                  environment is in and then in the logic of how to behave depending on
                  its state.
          </p>
      <p>
                  This chapter shows you how to determine your environment's
                  state, and it then shows you some sample code on how
                  an application might behave depending on whether it is a
                  master or a replica in a replicated application.

                        In order to determine whether your code is running
                        as a master or a replica, you must write your
                        application as an implementation of
                        <tt class="classname">com.sleepycat.db.EventHandler</tt>.
                        This class gives you a single method,
                        <tt class="methodname">handleEvent()</tt>, within
                        which you can detect and respond to various events
                        that occur in your DB code. 
                  </p>
        <p>
                          Note that <tt class="methodname">EventHandler</tt>
                          responds to a number of
                          <tt class="classname">com.sleepycat.db.EventType</tt>
                          events, only some of which are related to
                          replication. For replication, the events that we
                          care about are:

                                          synchronization and is now
                                          processing log records received
                                          from the master.

                                          An election was held and a new
                                          environment was made a master. However,
                                          the current environment <span class="emphasis"><em>is
                                          not</em></span> the master. This
                                  event exists so that you can
                                  cause your code to take some
                                  unique action in the event that the
                                  replication groups switches masters.
                                  </p>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                          Note that these events are raised whenever the
                          state is established. That is, when the current
                          environment becomes a client, and that includes
                          at application startup, the event is raised.
                          Also, when an election is held and a client is elected to be a
                          master, then the event occurs.
                  </p>
        <p>
                          The <tt class="classname">EventHandler</tt>
                          implementation is fairly simple. First you detect
                          the event, and then you record the state change
                          in some data member maintained in a location that
                          is convenient to you.
                  </p>
        <p>
                          For example:
                  </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">
package db.repquote;

// We make our main class an EventHandler implementation
...
import com.sleepycat.db.EventHandler;
...

public class MyReplicationClass implements EventHandler
{

...

// Somewhere we provide a data member that is used to track
// whether we are a master server. This could be in our main
// class, or it could be part of a supporting class.
private boolean isMaster;

...

isMaster = false;

...

// In the code where we open our environment and start replication,
// we must identify the class that is the event handler. In this
// example, we are performing this from within the class that 
// implements com.sleepycat.db.EventHandler so we identify
// "this" class as the event handler
envConfig.setEventHandler(this); </pre>
        <p>
        That done, we still need to implement the <tt class="methodname">handleEvent</tt>
        method. This implementation can be fairly trivial. 
</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">    public int handleEvent(EventType event)
    {
        int ret = 0;
        if (event == EventType.REP_MASTER)
            dbenv.setIsMaster(true);
        else if (event == EventType.REP_CLIENT)
            dbenv.setIsMaster(false);
        else if (event == EventType.REP_NEW_MASTER) {
            // ignored for now.
        } else {
            System.err.println("Unknown event callback received.\n");
            ret = 1;
        }
        return ret;
    } </pre>
        <p>
        Of course, this only gives us the current state of the environment. We
        still need the code that determines what to do when the environment 
        changes state and how to behave depending on the state (described
        in the next section).
