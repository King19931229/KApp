      <p>
        When reading and writing database records, be aware that there are some
        slight differences in behavior depending on whether your database supports duplicate
        records. Two or more database records are considered to be duplicates of 
        one another if they share the same key. The collection of records
        sharing the same key are called a <span class="emphasis"><em>duplicates set.</em></span>

        <span>
            In DB, a given key is stored only once for a single duplicates set.
        </span> 
    </p>
      <p>
        By default, DB databases do
        not support duplicate records. Where duplicate records are supported,
        cursors (see below) are <span>typically</span> used
        to access all of the records in the duplicates set.
    </p>
      <p>
        DB provides two basic mechanisms for the storage and retrieval of database
        key/data pairs:
    </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
            The 
             
            <tt class="methodname">DBT-&gt;put()</tt> 
             
            and
             
            <tt class="methodname">DBT-&gt;get()</tt> 
             
            methods provide the easiest access for all non-duplicate records in the database. 
            These methods are described in this section.
        </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cursors provide several methods for putting and getting database
        records. Cursors and their database access methods are described in
        <a href="Cursors.html">Using Cursors</a>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="databaseWrite"></a>Writing Records to the Database</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div></div>
        </div>
        <p>
        Records are stored in the database using whatever organization is
        required by the access method that you have selected. In some cases (such as
        BTree), records are stored in a sort order that you may want to define
        (see <a href="btree.html#comparators">Setting Comparison Functions</a> for more information). 
      </p>
        <p>
        In any case, the mechanics of putting and getting database records do not
        change once you have selected your access method, configured your
        sorting routines (if any), and opened your database. From your
        code's perspective, a simple database put and get is largely the
        same no matter what access method you are using.
      </p>
        <p>
          You use 
            <tt class="methodname">DB-&gt;put()</tt>
            
        to put, or write, a database record. This method requires you to provide
        the record's key and data in the form of a pair of
            <span><tt class="methodname">DBT</tt> structures.</span>
            
        You can also provide one or more flags that control DB's behavior
        for the database write.
      </p>
        <p>
        Of the flags available to this method, <tt class="literal">DB_NOOVERWRITE</tt>
        may be interesting to you. This flag disallows overwriting (replacing)
        an existing record in the database. If the provided key already exists
        in the database, then this method returns <tt class="literal">DB_KEYEXIST</tt> even if
        the database supports duplicates.
      </p>
        <p>
        For example:
    </p>
        <a id="c_dbt3"></a>
        <pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;db.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

...

char *description = "Grocery bill.";
DBT key, data;
DB *my_database;
int ret;
float money;

/* Database open omitted for clarity */

money = 122.45;

/* Zero out the DBTs before using them. */
memset(&amp;key, 0, sizeof(DBT));
memset(&amp;data, 0, sizeof(DBT));

key.data = &amp;money;
key.size = sizeof(float);

data.data = description;
data.size = strlen(description) +1; 

ret = my_database-&gt;put(my_database, NULL, &amp;key, &amp;data, DB_NOOVERWRITE);
if (ret == DB_KEYEXIST) {
    my_database-&gt;err(my_database, ret, 
      "Put failed because key %f already exists", money);
}</pre>

        You can use the
            <tt class="methodname">DB-&gt;get()</tt>
            
        method to retrieve database records. Note that if your 
        database supports duplicate records, then by default this method will only
        return the first record in a duplicate set. For this reason, if your
        database supports duplicates, the common solution is to use a cursor to retrieve
        records from it. Cursors are described in <a href="Cursors.html">Using Cursors</a>.
      </p>
        <p>
        (You can also retrieve a set of duplicate records using a bulk get. 
        To do this, you use the <tt class="literal">DB_MULTIPLE</tt> flag on the 
        call to 
            <span><tt class="methodname">DB-&gt;get()</tt>.</span>
            
        
        For more information, see the DB Programmer's Reference Guide).
      </p>
        <p>
          By default, 
            <tt class="methodname">DB-&gt;get()</tt>
            
        returns the first record found whose key matches the key 
        provide on the call to this method. If your database supports 
        duplicate records, you can change this behavior slightly by supplying
        the <tt class="literal">DB_GET_BOTH</tt> flag. This flag causes
            <tt class="methodname">DB-&gt;get()</tt>
            
        to return the first record that matches the provided key and data.
      </p>
        <p>
          If the specified key and/or data does not exist in the database, this
        method returns <tt class="literal">DB_NOTFOUND</tt>.
      </p>

        method to delete a record from the database. If your database supports

            When you perform a database modification, your modification is made
            in the in-memory cache.  This means that your data modifications
            are not necessarily flushed to disk, and so your data may not appear
            in the database after an application restart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that as a normal part of closing a database, its cache is
            written to disk. However, in the event of an application or system
            failure, there is no guarantee that your databases will close
            cleanly. In this event, it is possible for you to lose data. Under
            extremely rare circumstances, it is also possible for you to
            experience database corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, if you care if your data is durable across system
            failures, and to guard against the rare possibility of
            database corruption, you should use transactions to protect your
            database modifications. Every time you commit a transaction, DB
            ensures that the data will not be lost due to application or 
            system failure.  Transaction usage is described in the
                

                

                <span>
                <i class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Getting Started with Transaction Processing</i> guide.
                </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not want to use transactions, then the assumption is that
            your data is of a nature that it need not exist the next time your
            application starts. You may want this if, for example, you are using
            DB to cache data relevant only to the current application
            runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
            If, however, you are not using transactions for some reason and you
            still want some guarantee that your database modifications are
            persistent, then you should periodically
                
                <span>call <tt class="methodname">DB-&gt;sync()</tt>.</span>
                
            Syncs cause any dirty entries in the in-memory cache and the
            operating system's file cache to be written to disk. As
            such, they are quite expensive and you should use them sparingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that by default a sync is performed any time a non-transactional
            database is closed cleanly. (You can override this behavior by
            specifying 
                <tt class="literal">DB_NOSYNC</tt> 
                 
            on the call to 
                <span><tt class="methodname">DB-&gt;close()</tt>.)</span>
                
                
            
            That said, you can manually run a sync by calling
            
                <tt class="methodname">DB-&gt;sync().</tt>
                
                
            
        </p>
        <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
          <p>
                If your application or system crashes and you are not using
                transactions, then you should either discard and recreate your 
                databases, or verify them. You can verify a database using
                    <span>DB-&gt;verify().</span>
                    
                    
                If your databases do not verify cleanly, use the 
                <span><b class="command">db_dump</b></span> command to salvage as much of the
                database as is possible. Use either the <tt class="literal">-R</tt> or
                <tt class="literal">-r</tt> command line options to control how
                aggressive <span><b class="command">db_dump</b></span> should be when salvaging
                your databases.
