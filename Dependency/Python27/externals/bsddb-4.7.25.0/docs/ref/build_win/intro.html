<p align=center><b>Building for Windows</b></p>
<p>This page contains general instructions on building Berkeley DB for
specific windows platforms using specific compilers. The
<a href="../../ref/build_win/faq.html">Windows FAQ</a> also
contains helpful information.</p>
<p>The <b>build_windows</b> directory in the Berkeley DB distribution contains
project files for Microsoft Visual C++:</p>
<table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th>Project File</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>    <td align=center>Berkeley_DB.dsw</td>    <td align=center>Visual C++ 6.0 workspace</td>    </tr>
<tr>    <td align=center>*.dsp</td>    <td align=center>Visual C++ 6.0 projects</td>    </tr>
</table>
<p>These project files can be used to build Berkeley DB for the following platforms:
Windows NT/2K/XP/2003, Windows 98/ME and 64-bit Windows XP/2003.</p>
<b>Building Berkeley DB for Windows NT/2K/XP/2003</b>
<h4>Visual C++ .NET 2005</h4>
<ol>
<p><li>Choose <i>File -&gt; Open -&gt; Project/Solution...</i>.
In the <b>build_windows</b>, select <b>Berkeley_DB</b> and click
Open.
<p><li>You will be prompted to convert the project files to current Visual C++
format.  Select "Yes to All".
<p><li>Choose the project configuration from the drop-down menu on the tool
bar (usually Debug or Release for Win32).
<p><li>To build, right-click on the build_all target and select Build.
</ol>
<h4>Visual C++ .NET or Visual C++ .NET 2003</h4>
<p>This is very similar to the building with Visual Studio 2005, but some
menu options have been rearranged:</p>
<ol>
<p><li>Choose <i>File -&gt; Open Solution</i>.  Look in the
<b>build_windows</b> directory for compatible workspace files, select
<b>Berkeley_DB.dsw</b>, and press Open.
<p><li>You will be prompted to convert the project files to current Visual C++
format.  Select "Yes to All".
<p><li>Choose the project configuration from the drop-down menu on the .NET
tool bar (Debug or Release).
<p><li>To build, right-click on build_all and select Build.
</ol>
<h4>Visual C++ 6.0</h4>
<ol>
<p><li>Choose <i>File -&gt; Open Workspace</i>.  Look in the
<b>build_windows</b> directory for Workspaces, select
<b>Berkeley_DB.dsw</b>, and press Open.
<p><li>Choose the desired project configuration by going to <i>Build
-&gt; Set Active Configuration</i> and select the appropriate option
to the build_all project (Debug or Release).  Then click OK.
<p><li>To build, press F7.
</ol>
<h4>Build results</h4>
<p>The results of your build will be placed in a subdirectory of
<b>build_windows</b> named after the configuration you chose (for
examples, <b>build_windows\Release</b> or
<b>build_windows\Debug</b>).</p>
<p>When building your application during development, you should normally
use compile options "Debug Multithreaded DLL" and link against
<b>build_windows\Debug\libdb47d.lib</b>.  You can
also build using a release version of the Berkeley DB libraries and tools,
which will be placed in
<b>build_windows\Release\libdb47.lib</b>.  When
linking against the release build, you should compile your code with
the "Release Multithreaded DLL" compile option.  You will also need to
add the <b>build_windows</b> directory to the list of include
directories of your application's project, or copy the Berkeley DB include
files to another location.</p>
<b>Building Berkeley DB for Windows 98/ME</b>
<p>By default on Windows, Berkeley DB supports internationalized filenames by
treating all directory paths and filenames passed to Berkeley DB methods as
UTF-8 encoded strings.  All paths are internally converted to wide
character strings and passed to the wide character variants of Windows
system calls.</p>
<p>This allows applications to create and open databases with names that
cannot be represented with ASCII names while maintaining compatibility
with applications that work purely with ASCII paths.</p>
<p>Windows 98 and ME do not support Unicode paths directly.  To build for
those versions of Windows, either follow the above instructions,
choosing the "Debug ASCII" or "Release ASCII" build targets, or follow
the instructions at
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/mslu_announce.mspx">Microsoft's web site</a>.</p>
<p>The ASCII builds will also work on Windows NT/2K/XP and 2003, but will
not translate paths to wide character strings.</p>
<b>Building Berkeley DB for 64-bit Windows</b>
<p>The following procedure can be used on either to build natively on a
64-bit system or to cross-compile from a 32-bit system.</p>
<h4>x64 build with Visual Studio 2005</h4>
<ol>
<p><li>Choose <i>File -&gt; Open -&gt; Project/Solution...</i>.
In the <b>build_windows</b>, select <b>Berkeley_DB</b> and click
Open.
<p><li>You will be prompted to convert the project files to current Visual C++
format.  Select "Yes to All".
<p><li>Choose the project configuration from the drop-down menu on the tool
bar ("Debug AMD64", "Release AMD64").  Change the CPU type from
Win32 to x64.
<p><li>Right-click on the build_all target and select Build.
</ol>
<h4>64-bit build with Visual Studio .NET 2003 or earlier</h4>
<p>You will need latest Platform SDK from Microsoft, available from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">Microsoft's web site</a>.  You only need the "Core SDK" from there.</p>
<p>Once that is installed, you should have an entry in your Start Menu
called <i>Microsoft Platform SDK (date) -&gt; Open Build
Environment Window -&gt; Windows Server 2003 64-bit Build
Environment -&gt; Set Win Svr 2003 x64 Build Env (Debug)</i>.
Selecting that will open a command window with the environment set up
for 64-bit Windows development targeting AMD64-compatible CPUs.</p>
<p>Depending on how your computer is configured, you may need to run the
<b>vcvars32.bat</b> or script to set up the environment to build
from the command line with Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Then, in the <b>build_windows</b> directory in the Berkeley DB
distribution, run this for Visual Studio .NET:
<blockquote><pre>devenv Berkeley_DB.dsw</pre></blockquote>
Choose "Yes To All" in the dialog box that appears, then close Visual
Studio, then run:
<blockquote><pre>devenv Berkeley_DB.sln /build "Debug AMD64" /project "build_all" /useenv</pre></blockquote>
For Visual Studio 6, just run this instead:
<blockquote><pre>msdev Berkeley_DB.dsw /make "build_all - Debug AMD64" /useenv</pre></blockquote>
You should now have AMD64 binaries in the "Debug_AMD64" directory.</p>
<p>To build a release, open the "Retail" window instead of the "Debug"
window, and change Debug to Release in the above commands.  To build
for Itanium, change AMD64 and x64 to IA64.</p>
<b>Building Berkeley DB with Cygwin</b>
<p>To build Berkeley DB with Cygwin, follow the instructions in
<a href="../../ref/build_unix/intro.html">Building for UNIX</a>.</p>
<b>Building the C++ API</b>
<p>C++ support is built automatically on Windows.</p>
<b>Building the Java API</b>
<p>Java support is not built automatically.  The following instructions
assume that you have installed the Sun Java Development Kit in
<b>d:\java</b>.  Of course, if you installed elsewhere or have
different Java software, you will need to adjust the pathnames
accordingly.</p>
<h4>Building Java with Visual C++ .NET or above</h4>
<ol>
<p><li>Set your include directories.  Choose <i>Tools -&gt; Options
-&gt; Projects -&gt; VC++ Directories</i>.  Under the "Show
directories for" pull-down, select "Include files".  Add the full
pathnames for the <b>d:\java\include</b> and
<b>d:\java\include\win32</b> directories.  Then click OK.  These are
the directories needed when including jni.h.
<p><li>Set the executable files directories.  Choose <i>Tools -&gt;
Options -&gt; Projects -&gt; VC++ Directories</i>.  Under the "Show
directories for" pull-down, select "Executable files".  Add the full
pathname for the <b>d:\java\bin</b> directory, then click OK.  This is
the directory needed to find javac.
<p><li>Set the build type to Release or Debug in the drop-down on the .NET
tool bar.
<p><li>To build, right-click on db_java and select Build.  This builds the
Java support library for Berkeley DB and compiles all the java files,
placing the resulting <b>db.jar</b> and <b>dbexamples.jar</b>
files in the <b>build_windows\Release</b> or
<b>build_windows\Debug</b> subdirectory of Berkeley DB.
</ol>
<h4>Building Java with Visual C++ 6.0</h4>
<ol>
<p><li>Set the include directories.  Choose <i>Tools -&gt; Options
-&gt; Directories</i>.  Under the "Show directories for" pull-down,
select "Include files".  Add the full pathnames for the
<b>d:\java\include</b> and <b>d:\java\include\win32</b> directories.
These are the directories needed when including <b>jni.h</b>.
<p><li>Set the executable files directories.  Choose <i>Tools -&gt;
Options -&gt; Directories</i>.  Under the "Show directories for"
pull-down, select "Executable files".  Add the full pathname for the
<b>d:\java\bin</b> directory.  This is the directory needed to find
javac.
<p><li>Go to <i>Build -&gt; Set Active Configuration</i> and select
either the Debug or Release version of the db_java project.  Then
press OK.
<p><li>To build, select <i>Build -&gt; Build
libdb_java47.dll</i>.  This builds the Java support
library for Berkeley DB and compiles all the java files, placing the
resulting <b>db.jar</b> and <b>dbexamples.jar</b> files in the
<b>build_windows\Release</b> or <b>build_windows\Debug</b>
subdirectory of Berkeley DB.
</ol>
<p>To run Java code, set your environment variable <b>CLASSPATH</b>
to include the full pathname of these jar files, and your environment
variable <b>PATH</b> to include the <b>build_windows\Release</b>
subdirectory.  On Windows, remember that files or directories in the
<b>CLASSPATH</b> and <b>PATH</b> variables must be separated
by semicolons (unlike UNIX).  Then, try running the following command
as a test:</p>
<blockquote><pre>java db.AccessExample</pre></blockquote>
<p>If you want to run Java code using a Debug build, substitute 'Debug'
for 'Release' in the instructions above.  Make sure you use the Debug
JAR file with the Debug DLL and the Release JAR with the Release
DLL.</p>
<b>Building the Tcl API</b>
<p>Tcl support is not built automatically.  See
<a href="../../ref/tcl/intro.html">Loading Berkeley DB with Tcl</a> for
information on sites from which you can download Tcl and which Tcl
versions are compatible with Berkeley DB.  These notes assume that Tcl is
installed as <b>d:\tcl</b>, but you can change that if you want.</p>
<p>The Tcl library must be built as the same build type as the Berkeley DB
library (both Release or both Debug).  We found that the binary
release of Tcl can be used with the Release configuration of Berkeley DB,
but you will need to build Tcl from sources for the Debug
configuration.  Before building Tcl, you will need to modify its
makefile to make sure that you are building a debug version, including
thread support.  This is because the set of DLLs linked into the Tcl
executable must match the corresponding set of DLLs used by Berkeley DB.</p>
<h4>Building Tcl with Visual C++ .NET or above</h4>
<ol>
<p><li>Set the include directories.  Choose <i>Tools -&gt; Options
-&gt; Projects -&gt; VC++ Directories</i>.  Under the "Show
directories for" pull-down, select "Include files".  Add the full
pathname for <b>d:\tcl\include</b>, then click OK.  This is the
directory that contains <b>tcl.h</b>.
<p><li>Set the library files directory.  Choose <i>Tools -&gt;
Options -&gt; Projects -&gt; VC++ Directories</i>.  Under the "Show
directories for" pull-down, select "Library files".  Add the full
pathname for the <b>d:\tcl\lib</b> directory, then click OK.  This is
the directory needed to find
<b>tcl84g.lib</b> (or whatever the
library is named in your distribution).
<p><li>Set the build type to Release or Debug in the drop-down on the .NET
tool bar.
<p><li>To build, right-click on db_tcl and select Build.  This builds the Tcl
support library for Berkeley DB, placing the result into
<b>build_windows\Debug\libdb_tcl47d.dll</b> or
<b>build_windows\Release\libdb_tcl47.dll</b>.
</ol>
<p>If you use a version different from Tcl 8.4.x you will
need to change the name of the Tcl library used in the build (for
example, <b>tcl84g.lib</b>) to the
appropriate name.  To do this, right click on <i>db_tcl</i>, go to
<i>Properties -&gt; Linker -&gt; Input -&gt; Additional
dependencies</i> and change
<b>tcl84g.lib</b> to match the Tcl
version you are using.</p>
<h4>Building Tcl with Visual C++ 6.0</h4>
<ol>
<p><li>Set the include directories.  Choose <i>Tools -&gt; Options
-&gt; Directories</i>.  Under the "Show directories for" pull-down,
select "Include files".  Add the full pathname for
<b>d:\tcl\include</b>, then click OK.  This is the directory that
contains <b>tcl.h</b>.
<p><li>Set the library files directory.  Choose <i>Tools -&gt;
Options -&gt; Directories</i>.  Under the "Show directories for"
pull-down, select "Library files".  Add the full pathname for the
<b>d:\tcl\lib</b> directory, then click OK.  This is the directory
needed to find <b>tcl84g.lib</b> (or
whatever the library is named in your distribution).
<p><li>Go to <i>Build -&gt; Set Active Configuration</i> and select
either the Debug or Release version of the db_tcl project.  Then press
OK.
<p><li>To build, select <i>Build -&gt; Build
libdb_tcl47.dll</i>.  This builds the Tcl support
library for Berkeley DB, placing the result into
<b>build_windows\Debug\libdb_tcl47d.dll</b> or
<b>build_windows\Release\libdb_tcl47.dll</b>.
</ol>
<p>If you use a version different from Tcl 8.4.x you will
need to change the name of the Tcl library used in the build (for
example, <b>tcl84g.lib</b>) to the
appropriate name.  To do this, choose
<i>Project -&gt; Settings -&gt; db_tcl</i>
and change the Tcl library listed in the Object/Library modules
<b>tcl84g.lib</b> to match the Tcl version
you are using.</p>
<b>Distributing DLLs</b>
<p>When distributing applications linked against the DLL (not static)
version of the library, the DLL files you need will be found in the
<b>build_windows\Release</b> subdirectory, or
<b>build_windows\Debug</b> if you distribute a debug version.  You may
also need to redistribute DLL files needed for the compiler's runtime.
For Visual C++ 6.0, these files are <b>msvcrt.dll</b> and
<b>msvcp60.dll</b> if you built with a Release configuration, or
<b>msvcrtd.dll</b> and <b>msvcp60d.dll</b> if you are using a
Debug configuration.  Generally, these runtime DLL files can be
installed in the same directory that will contain your installed Berkeley DB
DLLs.  This directory may need to be added to your System PATH
environment variable.  Check your compiler's license and documentation
for specifics on redistributing runtime DLLs.</p>
