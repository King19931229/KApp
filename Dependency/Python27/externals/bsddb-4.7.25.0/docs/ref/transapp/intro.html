<p align=center><b>Transactional Data Store introduction</b></p>
<p>It is difficult to write a useful transactional tutorial and still keep
within reasonable bounds of documentation; that is, without writing a
book on transactional programming.  We have two goals in this section:
to familiarize readers with the transactional interfaces of Berkeley DB and
to provide code building blocks that will be useful for creating
applications.</p>
<p>We have not attempted to present this information using a real-world
application.  First, transactional applications are often complex and
time-consuming to explain.  Also, one of our goals is to give you an
understanding of the wide variety of tools Berkeley DB makes available to you,
and no single application would use most of the interfaces included in
the Berkeley DB library.  For these reasons, we have chosen to simply present
the Berkeley DB data structures and programming solutions, using examples that
differ from page to page.  All the examples are included in a standalone
program you can examine, modify, and run; and from which you will be able
to extract code blocks for your own applications.  Fragments of the
program will be presented throughout this chapter, and the complete text
of the <a href="transapp.cs">example program</a> for IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX)
standard systems is included in the Berkeley DB distribution.</p>
