<h3 align=center>Interface Changes introduced in DB 2.2.0:</h3>

<ol>

<li>
In DB 2.2.0, the handles returned by the DB subsystems, for example, the
db_appinit() function's DB_ENV, and the db_open() function's DB, are
free-threaded.  If you specify the DB_THREAD flag to each subsystem, or
globally using db_appinit(), you can then use the returned handle
concurrently in any number of threads.

<p>
There are some important caveats for using DB handles concurrently in
multiple threads:

<p><ol type=a>
<li>
The DB_THREAD flag must be specified for all subsystems either explicitly
by calling the subsystems open() function, or via the db_appinit()
function.  Setting the DB_THREAD flag inconsistently may result in
database corruption.

<p><li>
Spinlocks must have be implemented for the compiler/architecture
combination.  Attempting to specify the DB_THREAD flag will fail with an
EINVAL error if spinlocks are not available.

<p><li>
Only a single thread may call the close function for a returned database
or subsystem handle.  See
db_open(3)
and the appropriate subsystem manual pages for more information.

<p><li>
Either the DB_DBT_MALLOC or DB_DBT_USERMEM flags must be set in a DBT used
for key or data retrieval.  See
db_open(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
The DB_CURRENT, DB_NEXT and DB_PREV flags to the log_get() function may
not be used by a free-threaded handle.  If such calls are necessary, a
thread should explicitly create a unique DB_LOG handle by calling log_open().
See
db_log(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
Each database operation (that is, any call to a function underlying the
handles returned by db_open() and db_cursor()) is normally performed on
behalf of a locker associated with the handle.  If, within a single
thread of control, multiple calls on behalf of the same locker are
desired, then transactions must be used.  See db(3) for more
information.

<p><li>
Transactions may not span threads, that is, each transaction must begin
and end in the same thread, and each transaction may only be used by a
single thread.

</ol>

<p>
See
db(3)
and
db_appinit(3)
for more information on using DB in the context of threads.

<p><li>
We've added spinlock support for OSF/1, HP, Solaris and UTS4, in all cases
for the native compiler/architecture combination.  In the case of Solaris,
this means that all DB applications must be loaded using the <b>-lthread</b>
library.

<p><li>
We've added a C++ API for DB.
<font color=red>
There are not yet any manual pages for the C++ API, and the interface is
going to change!
</font>
Please feel free to browse and send us comments, but please remember
that the C++ interface is going to be different in the next release.
<p>
The C++ files and directories in the source distribution are:
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<td>db/cxx/</td>
<td>C++ API</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>db/examples_cxx/</td>
<td>The example programs recoded in C++.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>db/include/cxx_int.h</td>
<td>Internal C++ include file.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>db/include/db_cxx.h</td>
<td>External C++ include file.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
C++ support is automatically built on Win32.  To configure it under UNIX,
specify <b>--enable-cxx</b> as a configuration argument (see the file
<b>db/build.unix/README</b> for more information).

<p><li>
The functionality previously embodied in some of the support utilities
(db_archive(1),
db_checkpoint(1),
db_deadlock(1),
and
db_recover(1))
is now available through the DB API as well.
<p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><li>
We've added a new default hashing function, __ham_func5(), written by
Glenn Fowler, Landon Curt Noll and Phong Vo, and integrated into DB by
Ariel Faigon of SGI.  We've also deleted the previous supplied function
__ham_func1().
<p>
<font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>
We incremented the hash access method database version number, and the
new hash function will only be used in newly created databases, which
means that applications written using version DB 2.2.0 and greater will
be able to share databases with applications written using previous
versions of DB with a major number of 2.

<p>
However, we now use the __ham_func5() hash function internally, in the
log and lock subsystems, which means that applications written using
version DB 2.2.0 and greater will NOT be able to share database
environments, or read log files, written using previous versions of DB.

<p><li>
The interfaces that DB uses to export statistics have been enhanced and,
in one case, modified:

<p><ol type=a>
<li>
DB 2.2 exports statistical information via the DB handle for the access
methods.  Currently, the only access method for which this information is
available is B+tree.  See the dbp-&gt;db_stat() function in the
db_open(3)
manual page for more information.

<p><li>
DB 2.2 exports statistical information for the transaction region via a
new function, txn_stat().  See
db_txn(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
The
db_stat(1)
utility has two new options.  The <b>-d</b> flag permits users to display
the access method statistics.  The <b>-t</b> flag permits users to display
the transaction region statistics.

<p><li>
The interface for shared memory buffer pool statistics in DB 2.2 has been
revised to make it consistent with the interfaces provided for the
transaction region and access methods.
<font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>
See
db_mpool(3)
for more information.
</ol>

<p><li>
The interface to the shared memory buffer pool has been extended in DB
2.2 to permit applications to control the maximum size of read-only files
that will be mapped into the application's address space instead of being
read through the memory pool cache.  See the DB_NOMMAP flag to the
memp_open() function and the mp_mmapsize field in the DB_ENV structure,
as described in
db_mpool(3).

<p><li>
The interface to the transaction subsystem has been extended in DB 2.2 to
permit applications to specify that the log is not to be synchronously
flushed on transaction commit.  This potentially provides a significant
performance improvement for applications that do not require database
durability.  See the DB_TXN_NOSYNC flag to the txn_open() function, as
described in
db_txn(3).

<p><li>
There have been several changes to the process of creating a DB environment:

<p><ol type=a>
<li>
By default, when a lock is unavailable to a DB thread (or process), the
thread/process is put to sleep for a period of time, permitting other
threads/processes to run.  This may not be optimal in the presence of
multiple threads in a single process.  The DB_ENV structure has been
extended to permit applications to specify a ``yield'' function, which is
called when a DB thread has requested a lock which is unavailable.  See
db_appinit(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
In previous versions of DB, the DB_CREATE flag was implied by calling the
db_appinit() function, that is, initializing the environment implied that
the application wanted to create the environment if it did not already
exist.  This version of DB no longer supports this semantic, and the
DB_CREATE must be explicitly specified to db_appinit() if the application
wants to create the DB environment.
<font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
The flags that may be specified when creating the DB environment have been
extended in DB 2.2 to allow the specification of the DB_MPOOL_PRIVATE flag,
which was previously supported only by the underlying memory pool subsystem.
<p>
The flags that may be specified when creating the DB environment have been
extended in DB 2.2 to provide new functionality: the list of new flags
includes DB_NOMMAP, DB_THREAD and DB_TXN_NOSYNC.

<p><li>
The DB_DATA_DIR configuration argument to the db_appinit() function is
now additive, permitting applications to specify multiple directories in
which to
search for database files.  If multiple paths are specified, created data
files will always be created in the <b>first</b> directory specified.

<p><li>
The db_errbuf field of the DB_ENV structure has been deleted from the
current release.  In its place, we have added the db_errcall field, which
specifies a function which is called with the information previously found
in the db_errbuf buffer.
<font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
The default temporary file location list (used when no DB_TMP_DIR
configuration argument was specified) has been extended to include any
directory specified by the <b>TempFolder</b> environment variable, if it
exists.

</ol>

<p>
In all cases, see
db_appinit(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
There have been several changes to the logging subsystem:

<p><ol type=a>
<li>
The log_get() and log_put() functions now support the
standard DBT flags described by the
db_open(3)
manual page.

<p><li>
The interface to the log_flush() function has been extended to
flush the entire log if a NULL LSN is specified.  See
db_log(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
The interface to the log_file() function has been changed in DB 2.2
to eliminate the need for the library to return allocated memory
that may never be freed.
<font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>
See
db_log(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
The
db_checkpoint(1)
and
db_deadlock(1)
utilities have a new option, <b>-L</b>, in DB 2.2 to optionally log their
process ID to a file.  If they exit gracefully, or if they receive a
SIGINT signal, the log file is removed before they exit.

</ol>

<p><li>
There have been a couple of changes to the source code layout other
than those specified above:

<p><ol type=a>
<li>
Operating system specific functionality is separated out in DB 2.2 into
a separate subdirectory in the source code, <b>db/os</b>.

<p><li>
All of the include files in DB 2.2 have been moved into a single
subdirectory, <b>db/include</b>, as part of the work to port DB to MacOS.

</ol>
