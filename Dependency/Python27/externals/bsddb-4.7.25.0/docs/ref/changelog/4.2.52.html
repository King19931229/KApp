<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 4.2.52 Change Log</h3>

<h3>Database or Log File On-Disk Format Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Queue databases that use encryption or data checksum features with
extent files will need to be dumped and reloaded prior to using with
release 4.2. For more details please see the "Upgrading Berkeley DB
Applications, Queue Access Method" in the Berkeley DB Reference Guide
included in your download package. [#8671]
<li>The on-disk log format changed.

</ol>
<h3>New Features:</h3>
<ol>


<li>Add support for a reduced memory footprint build of the Berkeley DB
library. [#1967]
<li>Add the DB_MPOOLFILE-&gt;set_flags interface which disallows the
creation of backing filesystem files for in-memory databases. [#4224]
<li>Add cache interfaces to limit the number of buffers written
sequentially to allow applications to bound the time they will
monopolize the disk. [#4935]
<li>Support auto-deletion of log files. [#0040] [#6252]
<li>The new Java DBX API for Berkeley DB allows Java programmers to use
a familiar Java Collections style API, including Map, while interacting
with the transactional Berkeley DB core engine. [#6260]
<li>Support auto-commit with the DB-&gt;get method's consume operations.
[#6954]
<li>Add "get" methods to retrieve most settings. [#7061]
<li>Add Javadoc documentation to the Berkeley DB release. [#7110]
<li>Add support to Concurrent Data Store to allow duplication of write
cursors. [#7167]
<li>Add C++ utility classes for iterating over multiple key and data
items returned from a cursor when using the DB_MULTIPLE or
DB_MULTIPLE_KEY flags. [#7351]
<li>Add CamelCased methods to the Java API. [#7396]
<li>Add the DB_MPOOLFILE-&gt;set_maxsize interface to enforce a maximum
database size. [#7582]
<li>Add a toString() method for all Java *Stat classes (DbBtreeStat,
DbHashStat, DbMpoolStat, etc.). This method creates a listing of values
of all of the class member variables. [#7712]

</ol>
<h3>Database Environment Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Add cache interfaces to limit the number of buffers written
sequentially to allow applications to bound the time they will
monopolize the disk. [#4935]
<li>Fix a bug which could cause database environment open to hang, in
database environments supporting cryptography. [#6621]
<li>Fix a bug where a database environment panic might result from an
out-of-disk-space error while rolling back a page allocation. [#6694]
<li>Fix a bug where a database page write failure, in a database
environment configured for encryption or byte-swapping, could cause page
corruption. [#6791]
<li>Fix a bug where DB-&gt;truncate could drop core if there were active
cursors in the database. [#6846]
<li>Fix a bug where for databases sharing a physical file required a
file descriptor per database. [#6981]
<li>Fix a bug where the panic callback routine was only being called in
the first thread of control to detect the error when returning
DB_RUNRECOVERY. [#7019]
<li>Fix a bug where a transaction which contained a remove of a
subdatabase and an allocation to another subdatabase in the same file
might not properly be aborted. [#7356]
<li>Fix a bug to now disallow DB_TRUNCATE on opens in locking
environments, since we cannot prevent race conditions. In the absence
of locking and transactions, DB_TRUNCATE will truncate ANY file for
which the user has appropriate permissions. [#7345]
<li>Fix several bugs around concurrent creation of databases. [#7363]
<li>Change methods in DbEnv that provide access to statistics
information so that they now return instances of the proper classes.
[#7395]
<li>Replace the DB-&gt;set_cache_priority API with the
DB_MPOOLFILE-&gt;set_priority API. [#7545]
<li>Fix a bug where a failure during a creation of a subdatabase could
then fail in the dbremove cleanup, causing a crash. [#7579]
<li>Allow creating into a file that was renamed within the same
transaction. [#7581]
<li>Fix a bug where DB_ENV-&gt;txn_stat could drop core if there are
more-than-expected active transactions. [#7638]
<li>Change Berkeley DB to ignore user-specified byte orders when
creating a database in an already existing physical file. [#7640]
<li>Fix a bug where a database rename that is aborted would leak some
memory. [#7789]
<li>Fix a bug where files could not be renamed or removed if they were
not writable. [#7819]
<li>Fix a bug where an error during a database open may leak memory in
the mpool region. [#7834]
<li>Fix a bug where the DB_ENV-&gt;trickle_sync method could flush all of
the dirty buffers in the cache rather than a subset. [#7863]
<li>Fix a bug where an attempt to rename or remove an open file in the
same transaction could succeed, even though this is not allowed and will
not work on Windows. [#7917]
<li>Fix a bug where if a recovery interval in the log contained only
database opens then a recovery might report "Improper file close".
[#7886]
<li>Add a flag, DB_INIT_REP to DB_ENV-&gt;open to initialize Replication
subsystem. [#8299]
<li>Fix a bug where file remove and rename operations would not block
each other if they were in different transactions. [#8340]
<li>Change Berkeley DB to not propagate error returns from the
application's rep_send function out of the Berkeley DB API.
[#8496][#8522]
<li>Remove restriction that DB_TRUNCATE is not allowed on files with
subdatabases. This restriction was introduced in 4.1.25. [#8852]

</ol>
<h3>Concurrent Data Store Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where opens with other threads/processes actively acquiring
locks on database handles could deadlock. [#6286]
<li>Add support to Concurrent Data Store to allow duplication of write
cursors. [#7167]

</ol>
<h3>General Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where the truncate of a database with associated secondary
databases did not truncate the secondaries. [#6585]
<li>Fix a bug in which an out-of-disk condition during a transactional
database create, remove, or rename could cause a crash. [#6695]
<li>Fix a bug where system errors unknown to the C library could cause
Berkeley DB utilities to drop core on Solaris. [#6728]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB could overwrite incorrectly formatted
files rather than returning an error to the application during open.
[#6769]
<li>Fix a bug DB handle reference counts were incorrect, leading to
spurious warning about open DB handles. [#6818]
<li>Fix a bug where cursor adjustments across multiple DB handles could
fail. [#6820]
<li>Fix a bug where a failure during open could result in a hang.
[#6902]
<li>Fix a bug where repeated failures during certain stages of opens
could cause error messages to appear during recovery. [#7008]
<li>Fix a bug in secondary indices with multiple threads calling
DBC-&gtput that resulted in DB_NOTFOUND being returned. [#7124]
<li>Fix a bug where database verification might reference memory which
was previously freed after reporting an error. [#7137]
<li>Rename the DB_CHKSUM_SHA1 to DB_CHKSUM as Berkeley DB only uses SHA1
for encrypted pages, not for clear text pages. [#7095]
<li>Fix a bug where DB-&gt;rename could fail silently if the underlying
system rename call failed. [#7322]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB failed to open a file with FCNTL locking
and 0-length files. [#7345]
<li>Prohibit the use of the DB_RMW flag on get operations for DB handles
opened in transactional mode. [#7407]
<li>Standardize when Berkeley DB will return DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED, or
throw DbLockNotGrantedException, versus returning DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK or
throwing DbDeadlockException. Fix bugs in the C++ and Java APIs where
DbException was thrown, encapsulating DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED, rather than
throwing DbLockNotGrantedException. [#7549]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB could hang on a race condition if a
checkpoint was running at the same time another thread was closing a
database for the last time. [#7604]
<li>Fix several bugs that made multiple filesystem level operations
inside a single transaction break. [#7728]
<li>Fix a memory leak in the abort path of a sub-database create.
[#7790]
<li>Fix a race condition with file close that could cause NULL pointer
deference under load. [#8235]
<li>Fix a bug to correct the calculation of the amount of space needed
to return off page duplicates using the DB_MULTIPLE interface. [#8437]
<li>Fix a bug where the duplicate data item count could be incorrect if
a cursor was used to first overwrite and then delete a duplicate which
was part of a set of duplicates large enough to have been stored outside
the standard access method pages.  [#8445]
<li>Fix a bug where The DB_MULTIPLE interface might fail to return the
proper duplicates in some edge cases. [#8485]
<li>Fix a bug where DB-&gt;get(...DB_MULTIPLE) would not return a
reasonable estimate of the buffer size required to return a set of
duplicates.  [#8513]
<li>Fix a bug where the DbCursor.count method could return the wrong
count in the case of small (on-page) duplicate sets, where a still-open
cursor has been used to delete one of the duplicate data items. [#8851]
<li>Fix a bug where a non-transactional cursor using DB_MULTIPLE_KEY
could briefly be left pointing at an unlocked page. This could lead to
a race condition with another thread deleting records resulting in the
wrong record being deleted. [#8926]
<li>Fix a bug where a key/data item could be lost if a cursor is used
to do a delete, and then immediately used to do an insert which causes
a set of duplicates to be shifted to an off-page Btree. [#9085]

</ol>
<h3>Btree Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where a deleted item could be left on a database page
causing database verification to fail. [#6059]
<li>Fix a bug where a page may be left pinned in the cache if a deadlock
occurs during a DB-&gt;put operation. [#6875]
<li>Fix a bug where a deleted record may not be removed from a Btree
page if the page is split while another cursor is trying to delete a
record on the page. [#6059]
<li>Fix a bug where records marked for deletion were incorrectly counted
when retrieving in a Btree by record number. [#7133]
<li>Fix a bug where a page and lock were left pinned if an application
requested a record number past the end of the file when retrieving in a
Btree by record number. [#7133]
<li>Fix a bug where deleted keys were included in the key count for the
DB-&gtstat call. [#7133]
<li>Fix a bug where specifying MULTIPLE_KEY and NEXT_DUP to the bulk get
interfaces might return the wrong data if all the duplicates could not
fit in a single buffer. [#7192]
<li>Remove assertions that triggered failures that were correct
executions. [#8032]
<li>Fix a bug where duplicate data items were moved onto overflow pages
before it was necessary. [#8082]
<li>Fix a bug where the DB-&gt;verify method might incorrectly complain
about a tree's overflow page reference count. [#8061]
<li>Fix a bug that could cause DB_MULTIPLE on a Btree database to return
an incorrect data field at the end of buffer. [#8442]
<li>Fix a bug where DBC-&gt;c_count was returning an incorrect count if the
cursor was positioned on an item that had just been deleted. [#8851]
<li>Remove the test for bt_maxkey in the Btree put code. If it is set
to 1 it can cause an infinite loop. [#8904]

</ol>
<h3>Hash Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where Hash databases could be corrupted on filesystems
that do not zero-fill implicitly created blocks. [#6588]
<li>Fix a bug where creating a Hash database with an initial size larger
than 4GB would fail. [#6805]
<li>Fix a bug where a page in an unused hash bucket might not be empty
if there was a disk error while writing the log record for the bucket
split. [#7035]
<li>Fix a bug where two threads opening a hash database at the same time
might deadlock. [#7159]
<li>Fix a bug where a hash cursor was not updated properly when doing a
put with DB_NODUPDATA specified. [#7361]
<li>Fix a bug that could cause DB_MULTIPLE_KEY on Hash databases to
return improper results when moving from a key with duplicates to a key
without duplicates. [#8442]

</ol>
<h3>Queue Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where opening an in-memory Queue database with extent size
specified will dump core. [#6795]
<li>Support auto-commit with the DB-&gt;get method's consume operations.
[#6954]
<li>Fix a bug where calling the sync method on a queue database with
extents may hang if there are active consumers. [#7022]
<li>Fix a bug where a get(...MULTIPLE...) might lead to an infinite loop
or return the wrong record number(s) if there was a deleted record at
the beginning of a page or the buffer was filled exactly at the end of
a page. [#7064]
<li>Fix a bug where a database environment checkpoint might hang if a
thread was blocked waiting for a record while doing a DB_CONSUME_WAIT
on a Queue database. [#7086]
<li>Fix a bug where queue extent files would not be removed if a queue
with extents was removed and its record numbers wrapped around the
maximum record number. [#7191]
<li>Fix a bug where a DB-&gt;remove of an extent based Queue with a small
number of pages per extent would generate a segmentation fault. [#7249]
<li>Fix a bug where verify and salvage on queues with extent files did
not consider the extent files. [#7294]
<li>Fix a bug when transaction timeouts are set in the environment they
would get applied to some non-transactional operations and could cause
a failure during the abort of a queue operation. [#7641]
<li>Fix a bug when the record numbers in a queue database wrap around
at 232, a cursor positioned on a record near the head of the queue that
is then deleted, may return DB_NOTFOUND when get is specified with
DB_NEXT rather than the next non-deleted record. [#7979]
<li>Fix a bug where a record lock will not be removed when the first
record in the queue is deleted without a transaction (not using
DB_CONSUME). [#8434]
<li>Fix a bug where byte swapping was not handled properly in queue
extent files. [#8358]
<li>Fix a bug where Queue extent file pages were not properly typed,
causing the extent files not to use encryption or checksums, even if
those options had been specified. This fix requires a database upgrade
for any affected Queue databases. [#8671]
<li>Fix a bug where truncating a queue with extents may fail to remove
the last extent file. [#8716]
<li>Fix a bug where a rename or remove of a QUEUE database with extents
might leave empty extent files behind. [#8729]
<li>Fix a bug where on Windows operating systems a "Permission denied"
error may be raised if a Queue extent is reopened while it is in the
process of being unlinked. [#8710]

</ol>
<h3>Recno Access Method Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where the DB-&gt;truncate method may return the wrong record
count if there are deleted records in the database. [#6788]
<li>Fix a bug where internal nodes of Recno trees could get wrong record
count if a log write failed and the log was later applied during
recovery. [#6841]
<li>Fix a bug where a cursor next operation could infinitely loop after
deleting a record, when the deleted record was immediately followed by
implicitly created records. [#8133]

</ol>
<h3>C++-specific API Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Document the DB-&gt;del method can return DB_KEYEMPTY for Queue or
Recno databases. The C++ and Java APIs now return this value rather than
throwing an exception. [#7030]
<li>Add "get" methods to retrieve most settings. [#7061]
<li>Fix a bug where applications calling DB-&gt;verify from the C++ or Java
APIs could drop core. Change the DB-&gt;verify method API to act as a DB
handle destructor. [#7418]
<li>Add utility classes for iterating over multiple key and data items
returned from a cursor when using the DB_MULTIPLE or DB_MULTIPLE_KEY
flags. These classes, DbMultipleDataIterator, DbMultipleKeyDataIterator,
and DbMultipleRecnoDataIterator, mirror the DB Java API and are provided
as replacements for the C macros, DB_MULTIPLE_INIT, DB_MULTIPLE_NEXT,
DB_MULTIPLE_KEY_NEXT, and DB_MULTIPLE. [#7351]
<li>Fix a bug DbException was thrown, encapsulating DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED,
rather than throwing DbLockNotGrantedException. [#7549]
<li>Add the DbEnv handle to exceptions thrown by the C++ and Java APIs,
where possible. [#7303]
<li>Fix a bug in the C++ DbEnv::set_rep_transport signature so that the
envid parameter is signed. [#8303]
<li>Make the fields of DB_LSN public in the DbLsn class. [#8422]

</ol>
<h3>Java-specific API Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>New Java API (com.sleepycat.dbx.*) for the transactional storage of
data using the Java Collections design pattern. [#6569]
<li>Fix a bug in the Java Dbt.get_recno_key_data() method when used
inside callbacks. [#6668]
<li>Fix Java DbMpoolStat class to match the DB_MPOOL_STAT struct.
[#6821]
<li>Fix a bug where Dbc.put expected key data even if the key was
unused. [#6932]
<li>Fix a bug in the Java API secondary_key_create callback where memory
was freed incorrectly, causing JVM crashes. [#6970]
<li>Re-implement the Java API to improve performance and maintenance.
Fix several inconsistencies in the Java API:
<ol type="a">
<li>Db.put(), Dbc.get() and Dbc.put() preserve key size
<li>Dbc.get() returns DB_KEYEMPTY rather than throwing an exception
<li>The return type of Db.close() is now void. [#7002]
</ol>
<li>Document the DB-&gt;del method can return DB_KEYEMPTY for Queue or
Recno databases. The C++ and Java APIs now return this value rather than
throwing an exception. [#7030]
<li>Add "get" methods to retrieve most settings. [#7061]
<li>Add Javadoc documentation to the Berkeley DB release. [#7110]
<li>Fix a bug that caused potential memory corruption when using the
Java API and specifying the DB_DBT_REALLOC flag. [#7215]
<li>Add the DbEnv handle to exceptions thrown by the C++ and Java APIs,
where possible. [#7303]
<li>Map existing c-style API to a more Java camel case API with Java
style naming. Retained deprecated older API for the 4.2 release for
backwards support in all cases except callback interfaces. Also
overloaded methods such as get/pget() into multiple different get()
calls to clean up call structure. [#7378]
<li>Add CamelCased methods to the Java API. [#7396]
<li>Fix a bug where applications calling DB-&gt;verify from the C++ or Java
APIs could drop core. Change the DB-&gt;verify method API to act as a DB
handle destructor. [#7418]
<li>Fix a bug DbException was thrown, encapsulating DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED,
rather than throwing DbLockNotGrantedException. [#7549]
<li>Add a toString() method for all Java *Stat classes (DbBtreeStat,
DbHashStat, DbMpoolStat, etc.). This method creates a listing of values
of all of the class member variables. [#7712]
<li>Remove Db.fd() method from Java API as it has no value to a Java
programmer. [#7716]
<li>Add an accessible timeout field in the DbLockRequest class, needed
for the DB_LOCK_GET_TIMEOUT operation of DbEnv.lockVector. [#8043]
<li>Fix replication method calls from Java API.  [#8467]
<li>Fix a bug where exception returns were inconsistent. [#8622]
<li>Change the Java API so that it throws an IllegalArgumentException
rather than a DbException with the platform-specific EINVAL. [#8978]

</ol>
<h3>Tcl-specific API Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Add "get" methods to retrieve most settings. [#7061]
<li>Brought Tcl's $env set_flags command up to date with available flags.
[#7385]
<li>Update Berkeley DB to compile cleanly against the Tcl/Tk 8.4 release.
[#7612]
<li>Made txn_checkpoint publicly available. [#8594]

</ol>
<h3>RPC-specific Client/Server Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix two bugs in the RPC server where incorrect handling of illegal
environment home directories caused server crashes. [#7075]
<li>Fix a bug where the DB_ENV-&gt;close method would fail in RPC clients
if the DB_ENV-&gt;open method was never called. [#8200]

</ol>
<h3>Replication Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Write prepare records synchronously on replication clients so that
prepare operations are always honored in the case of failure. [#6416]
<li>Change replication elections so that the client with the biggest LSN
wins, and priority is a secondary factor. [#6568]
<li>Fix a bug where replicas could not remove log files because the
checkpoint lsn was not being updated properly. [#6620]
<li>Force prepare records out to disk regardless of the setting of the
DB_TXN_NOSYNC flag. [#6614]
<li>Add a new flag, DB_REP_NOBUFFER, which gets passed to the rep_send
function specified in DBENV-&gt;rep_set_transport, to indicate that the
message should not be buffered on the master, but should be immediately
transmitted to the client(s). [#6680]
<li>Fix a replication election bug where Berkeley DB could fail to elect
a master even if a master already existed. [#6702]
<li>Allow environment wide setting of DB_AUTO_COMMIT on replication
clients. [#6732]
<li>Fix a replication bug where a client coming up in the midst of an
election might not participate in the election. [#6826]
<li>Add log_flushes when sites become replication masters. If log_flush
fails, panic the environment since the clients already have the commits.
[#6873]
<li>Fix a replication bug where a brand new client syncing up could
generate an error on the master. [#6927]
<li>Fix a bug where clients synchronize with the master when they come
up with the same master after a client-side disconnect or failures.
[#6986]
<li>Fix several bugs in replication elections turned up by test rep005.
[#6990]
<li>Fix a bug where aborted hash group allocations were not properly
applied on replicas. [#7039]

threads calling replication and other Berkeley DB functions. [#7402]
[#8035]
<li>Use shared memory region for all replication flags. [#7573]
<li>Fix a bug where log archive on clients could prematurely remove log
files. [#7659]
<li>Return an error if a non-replication dbenv handle attempts to write
log records to a replication environment. [#7752]
<li>Fix a race condition when clients applied log records, where we
would store a log record locally and then never notice we have it, and
need to re-request it from the master, causing the client to get far
behind the master. [#7765]
<li>Fix inconsistencies between the documentation and actual code
regarding when replication methods can be called. [#7775]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB would wait forever if a NEWMASTER
message got dropped. [#7897]
<li>Fix a bug where the master environment ID did not get set when you
called DBENV-&gt;rep_start as a master. [#7899]
<li>Fix a bug where operations on a queue database will not get
replicated if the transactions that include the operations are committed
out of order with the operations. [#7904]
<li>Fix bugs in log_c_get where an invalid LSN could access invalid
addresses. Fix bug in elections where a client upgrading to master
didn't write a txn_recycle record. [#7964]
<li>Fix a bug where REP_VERIFY_FAIL during client recovery wasn't being
handled. [#8040]
<li>Return an error if the application calls rep_process_message before
calling rep_start when starting. [#8057]
<li>Fix a bug to ensure that replication generation numbers always
increase and are never reset to 1. [#8136]
<li>Modify log message retransmission protocol to efficiently handle the
case where a large number of contiguous messages were dropped at once.
[#8182] [#8169] [#8188]
<li>Fix a bug where using the wrong mutex in replication which under
certain conditions could cause replication to hang. Also fix a bug where
incorrectly setting the checkpoint LSN could cause recovery to take a
very long time. [#8183]
<li>Fix bug where a message could get sent to an invalid master. [#8184]
<li>Fix a bug where a local variable in log_archive was not initialized.
[#8230]
<li>Fix a bug where elections could hang. [#8254]
<li>Fix a bug to ensure that we can always remove/re-create the temporary
replication database after a failure. [#8266]
<li>Add a flag, DB_INIT_REP to DB_ENV-&gt;open to initialize Replication
subsystem. [#8299]
<li>Add new ret_lsnp argument to rep_process_message so that LSNs can
be returned to clients on permanent records. Add new lsnp arg to the
send callback function so that the master can know the LSNs of records
as well. [#8308]
<li>Narrow the window where we block due to client recovery. [#8316]
<li>Fix a bug in log_c_incursor where we would not detect that a record
was already in the buffer. [#8330]
<li>Fix a bug that would allow elections to be managed incorrectly.
[#8360]
<li>Fix a bug where replicas were not maintaining meta-&gtlast_pgno
correctly. [#8378]
<li>Fix a bug in truncating log after recovery to a timestamp or
replication-based recovery. [#8387]
<li>Fix a bug where a checkpoint record written as the first record in
a log could cause recovery to fail. [#8391]
<li>Fix a bug where a client would return DB_NOTFOUND instead of
DB_REP_OUTDATED when it was unable to synchronize with the master
because it ran out of log records. [#8399]
<li>Fix a bug where log file changes were not handled properly in
replication.  [#8400] [#8420]
<li>Fix a bug where checking for invalid log header data could fail
incorrectly. [#8460]
<li>Fix a bug where DB_REP_PERMANENT was not being set when log records
were re-transmitted.  [#8473]
<li>Modify elections so that all participants elect in the same election
generation. [#8590]
<li>Fix bug where rep_apply was masking an error return. Also return
DB_RUNRECOVERY if the replication client cannot commit or checkpoint.
[#8636]
<li>Fix a bug to update the last_pgno on the meta page on free as well
as alloc. [#8637]
<li>Fix a bug to roll back the LSN on a queue database metapage if we're
going to truncate the log. Fix a bug in MASTER_CHECK so we don't apply
log messages from an unknown master. Fix a bug to perform a sync on
rep_close. [#8601]
<li>Fix a bug so that we reset the LSN when putting pages on the free
list. [#8685]
<li>Fix a bug where replication was not properly calling db_shalloc.
[#8811]

result in a checksum error in the log. [#6760]
<li>Fix a bug where we were not properly handling DB_AUTO_COMMIT in XA
transactions and where we were not honoring the XA transaction during
an XA-protected open. [#6851]
<li>Add infrastructure support for multithreaded XA. [#6865]
<li>Display XA status and ID as part of db_stat -t output. [#6413]

</ol>
<h3>Locking Subsystem Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where locks were not cleared in an off-page duplicate
cursor. [#6950]
<li>Fix a bug where a deadlock may not be detected if dirty reads are
enabled and the deadlock involves an aborting transaction. [#7143]
<li>Fix a bug where a transaction doing updates while using dirty read
locking might fail while aborting the transaction with a deadlock.
Several other locking issues were also fixed:
<ol type="a">
<li>failure to remove dirty read locks prior to aborting a transaction,
<li>calling upgrade on other than WWRITE locks,
<li>failure to remove expired locks from the locker queue,
<li>clearing the lock timeout before looking at it. [#7267]
</ol>
<li>Fix a bug when dirty reads are enabled a writer might be blocked on
a lock that it had previously obtained. Dirty readers would also wait
behind regular readers when they could have safely read a page. [#7502]
<li>Fix a bug where a DB-&gtput using CDB gets a lock timeout then the
error "Closing already closed cursor". [#7597]
<li>Modify the maximum test-and-set mutex sleep for logical page locks
at 10ms, everything else at 25ms. [#7675]
<li>Fix a bug where the DB_LOCK_TIMEOUT mode of env-&gt;lock_vec could
hang. [#7682]
<li>Fix a bug where running with only transaction timeouts for deadlock
detection might deadlock without being detected if more than one
transaction times out while trying to avoid searching a Btree on
repeated inserts. [#7787]
<li>Fix a bug that could cause detection to not run when there was a
lock that should be timed out. [#8588]
<li>Fix a bug with using dirty reads with subtransactions. If a writing
subtransaction aborts and then is blocked, the deadlock may not be
detected. [#9193]
<li>Fix a bug where handle locks were not being correctly updated when
releasing read locks during transaction prepare. [#9275]

</ol>
<h3>Logging Subsystem Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where if a write error occurred while committing a
transaction with DB_WRITE_NOSYNC enabled the transaction may appear to
be committed in the log while it was really aborted. [#7034]
<li>Fix a bug where multiprocess applications could violate write-ahead
logging requirements if one process wrote a log record but didn't flush
it, the current log file then changed, and another process wrote a
database page before the log record was written to disk. [#6999]
<li>Fix a bug where fatal recovery could fail with a "Transaction
already committed" error if recovery had been run and there are no
active transactions in the part of the log following the last
checkpoint. [#7234]
<li>Fix a bug where recovery would fail to put freed pages onto the free
list, when both committed and aborted subtransactions that allocated new
pages were present. This only affected prepared transactions. [#7403]
<li>Fix a bug where open errors during recovery get propagated unless
they are reporting missing files, which might correctly have been
removed. [#7578]
<li>Fix a bug so that we now validate a log file before writing to it.
[#7580]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB could display the unnecessary error
message "DB_LOGC-&gt;get: short read" during recovery. [#7700]
<li>Fix a bug where recovery may fail if it tries to reallocate a page
to a file that is out of space. [#7780]
<li>Change Berkeley DB so that operations on databases opened in a
non-transactional mode do not write records into the database logs.
[#7843]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB could timeout waiting for locks (on
Queue databases) during recovery. [#7927]
<li>Fix a bug in truncating log after recovery to a timestamp or
replication-based recovery. [#8387]
<li>Fix a bug where recovery can be slow if the log contains many opens
of files which contain multiple databases. [#8423]
<li>Fix a bug where a file id could be used before its open was logged.
[#8496]
<li>Fix a bug where recovery would partially undo a database create if
the transaction which created it spanned log files and not all of the
log files were present during recovery. [#9039]

</ol>
<h3>Memory Pool Subsystem Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where checksummed files could not be read on different
endian systems. [#6429]
<li>Fix a bug where read-only databases were not mapped into memory but
were instead read through the Berkeley DB buffer cache. [#6671]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB could loop infinitely if the cache was
sized so small that all of its pages were simultaneously pinned by the
application. [#6681]
<li>Fix a bug where DbEnv.sync could fail to write a page if another
thread unpinned the page at the same time and there were no other pages
in that hash bucket. [#6793]
<li>Fix a bug where threads of control may hang if multiple threads of
control are opening and closing a database at the same time. [#6953]
<li>Fix a bug where a database created without checksums but later
opened with checksums would result in a checksum error. [#6959]
<li>Fix a bug where a multiprocess application suite could see
incorrect data if one process opened a non-checksummed database
correctly and another process subsequently opened the same database,
specifying checksums. [#6959]
<li>Change to avoid database open and flush when handles are discarded,
if the handle was never used to write anything. [#7232]
<li>Fix a bug where applications dirtying the entire cache in a single
database operation would see large performance degradation. [#7273]
<li>Fix a bug where contention in the buffer pool could cause the buffer
allocation algorithm to unnecessarily sleep waiting for buffers to be
freed. [#7572]

</ol>
<h3>Transaction Subsystem Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where disk write errors in encrypted database
environments, causing transaction abort, could corrupt the log. [#6768]
<li>Fix a bug where catastrophic recovery may fail on a log which has a
prepared transaction which aborted the allocation of a new page and was
rolled forward previously by another recovery session. [#6790]
<li>Fix a bug where a transaction that contains a database truncate
followed by page allocations, may not properly undo the truncate if
aborted. [#6862]
<li>Fix a bug which causes Berkeley DB to checkpoint quiescent database
environments. [#6933]
<li>Fix a bug where if a transaction prepare fails while writing the
prepare log record, and it contains a subtransaction which did an
allocation later, recovery of the database may fail with a log sequence
error. [#6874]
<li>Do not abort prepared but not yet completed transactions when
closing an environment. [#6993]
<li>Fix a bug where operations on the source of a rename in the same
transaction would fail. [#7537]
<li>Fix a bug where a parent transaction which aborts when it tries to
write its commit record could fail with a log sequence error, if the
parent transaction has an aborted child transaction which allocated a
new page from the operating system. [#7251]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB could try to abort a partial transaction
because it contained a partial subtransaction. [#7922]
<li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB could drop core when transactions were
configured without locking support. [#9255]

</ol>
<h3>Utility Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Fix a bug where db_load could core dump or corrupt record numbers
by walking off the end of a string. [#6985]
<li>Fix a bug where db_load could run out of locks when loading large
numbers of records. [#7173]
<li>Fix a bug where db_dump could drop core when salvaging unaligned
entries on a Btree page. [#7247]
<li>Fix a bug where hash statistics did not include overflow items in
the count of database data elements. [#7473]
<li>Fix a bug where an corruption in an overflow page list could cause
DB-&gt;verify to infinitely loop. [#7663]
<li>Fix a bug where verify could display extraneous error messages when
verifying a Btree with corrupt or missing pages. [#7750]
<li>Fix a bug that could cause the db_stat utility to display values
larger than 100 for various percentages. [#7779]
<li>Fix a memory overflow bug in db_load. [#8124]
<li>Fix a minor leak when verifying queue databases. [#8620]
