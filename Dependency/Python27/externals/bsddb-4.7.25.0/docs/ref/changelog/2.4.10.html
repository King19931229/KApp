<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 2.4.10 Change Log</h3>

<h3>Interface Changes Introduced in DB 2.4.10:</h3>
<ol>

<p><li>
Support has been added for architectures with 16-bit integers, largely to
port Berkeley DB to the Windows 3.1 platform.  This required <b>extensive</b>
code changes, although almost all of them were only semantic in nature.
In almost all of the DB public interfaces, including any public structure
elements, all variables of type "int" or "unsigned int" have been converted
to be either type "int32_t" or "u_int32_t".
<p>
Previously built binaries on any 32-bit machine should be backward
compatible, however, previously built binaries on machines with 64-bit
integers will not be binarily compatible.  Applications should recompile
correctly without warning or error, unless there are explicit casts in
the application source code.
<font color=red>
This change may NOT be transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
Support has been added to allow Berkeley DB to use shared memory backed
by a paging file or swap space (as opposed to backed by the regular file
system) on both UNIX and Win95/WNT platforms.  This required a major
rework of the shared memory support in DB, and, for this reason, the DB
version 2.4.10 release should, perhaps, be tested more thoroughly than
usual in your local environment before committing to the upgrade.  This
change caused the
db_jump_set(3)
and
db_value_set(3)
functions to change.
<p>
The
db_jump_set(3)
function interface specified by the DB_FUNC_MAP flag has changed.
A new interface, specified by the DB_FUNC_RUNLINK flag has been added.
Applications replacing these functions at run time will
require additional care in upgrading to this release of DB.
<p>
The
db_value_set(3)
function interface has two additional flags: DB_REGION_ANON and
DB_REGION_NAME, which allow applications to specify regions are
to be created when using memory backed by a paging file.
<p>
See the
db_internal(3)
manual page for further information.

<p><li>
The
db_jump_set(3)
interface no longer supports the DB_FUNC_CALLOC and DB_FUNC_STRDUP flags.
Applications may continue to set the functions associated with those flags,
but they are no longer needed and no longer have any effect.

<p><li>
The
db_value_set(3)
interface has an additional flag: DB_REGION_INIT, which permits applications
to specify that regions should be page-faulted into memory immediately upon
creation.
This fixes a problem where the additional time required to page-fault in
region memory caused locks to convoy inside of the shared memory buffer pool.
<p>
This additionally required an interface change to the DB_FUNC_SEEK interface
as specified by the
db_jump_set(3)
function interface.
The "relative" argument is now a "u_int32_t" instead of a "u_long",
and there is an additional argument "isrewind" in order to support
seeking in the reverse direction.
<p>
See the
db_internal(3)
manual page for further information.
<font color=red>
This change may NOT be transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
The
log_put(3)
function has an additional flag: DB_CURLSN, which permits applications
to determine the next log LSN value which will be used.
This, coupled with changes to the transaction subsystem to no longer
write transaction-begin records allows Berkeley DB to avoid writing
any log records in the case of read-only transactions.

<p><li>
The interface to the
hcreate(3)
function has been changed to take a "size_t" as an argument instead of
an "unsigned int", for compatibility with vendor platforms, notably Solaris.
<font color=red>
This change may NOT be transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
Specifying NULL or zero-length keys to DB functions is now explicitly
disallowed by most of the DB interfaces, and EINVAL will be returned.
<font color=red>
This change may NOT be transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
Performance measurements of Berkeley DB indicated that a significant
amount of time was being spent clearing pages created in the shared
memory buffer pool.
In order to fix this, additional information has been added to the
memp_fopen(3)
interface which allows callers to specify the number of bytes which
need to be cleared when pages are created in the pool.
The default behavior of the pool code is unchanged, and by default the
entire page is cleared.
<p>
However, the
memp_fopen(3)
function interface has changed: 4 of the lesser-used historic arguments
and the new argument have been moved to an information structure of type
DB_MPOOL_FINFO which is passed to the memp_fget function as an argument.
See the
db_mpool(3)
man page for more information.
<font color=red>
This change may NOT be transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
An interface has been added to the
db_checkpoint(1)
function allowing database administrators to force a single checkpoint.
See the
db_checkpoint(1)
man page for more information.

</ol>

<h3>Configuration and Build Changes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
The environment variables used to specify a compiler, loader or compile
and loader flags during DB configuration have been changed to be more in
line with standard GNU autoconf practice.  The changes are as follows:
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>Old Name</td><td>New Name</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADDCPPFLAGS</td><td>CPPFLAGS</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADDCXXFLAGS</td><td>CXXFLAGS</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADDLDFLAGS</td><td>LDFLAGS</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADDLIBS</td><td>LIBS</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
See the file build.unix/README for further information.

<p><li>
The DB debugging support (previously configured by specifying
<b>--enable-debug</b> during configuration) has been split into two
separate pieces of functionality.
<p>
To build DB with -g as a compiler flag and with DEBUG #defined during
compilation, enter <b>--enable-debug</b> as an argument to configure.
This will create DB with debugging symbols, as well as load various
routines that can be called from a debugger to display pages, cursor
queues and so forth.  This flag should probably not be specified when
configuring to build production binaries, although there shouldn't be
any significant performance degradation.
<p>
To build DB with diagnostic, run-time sanity checks and with DIAGNOSTIC
#defined during compilation, enter <b>--enable-diagnostic</b> as an
argument to configure.  This will cause a number of special checks to be
performed when DB is running.  This flag should <b>NOT</b> be specified
when configuring to build production binaries, as you will lose a
significant amount of performance.

<p><li>
Some systems, notably versions of AIX, HP/UX and Solaris, require
special compile-time options in order to create files larger than
2^32 bytes. These options are automatically enabled when DB is
compiled.  For this reason, binaries built on current versions of
these systems may not run on earlier versions of the system, as
the library and system calls necessary for large files are not
available.  To disable building with these compile-time options,
enter <b>--disable-bigfile</b>.

<p><li>
The autoconf configure script has been enhanced to correctly support
<b>--disable-feature</b> or <b>--enable-feature=no</b> options.

<p><li>
The Berkeley DB test suite has been re-ordered to run system tests before
the tests of the individual access methods.

<p><li>
The Berkeley DB test suite has been largely ported to the Windows 3.1
environment.  See the distribution file test/README.win32 for more
information.

<p><li>
Mutex lock support for the GCC compiler and the PaRisc architecture has
been added.

<p><li>
The db_printlog(1) debugging utility is now built by default,
and the
db_stat(1)
utility is now built on Win95/WNT platforms.

<p><li>
A number of C, C++ and Java compiler warnings have been fixed.

<p><li>
Support has been added for the Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG
ReliantUNIX platform.

<p><li>
Ports of Berkeley DB to the HP MPE/iX and Windows 3.1 environments have
been begun.  They are not yet complete.

</ol>

<h3>B+tree Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
When performing btree range searches (that is, using the DB_SET_RANGE
interface, or using the DB version 1.85 compatibility interface), the
Btree access method could incorrectly return already deleted records.

<p><li>
When using a cursor to delete key/data pairs from a btree database, it
was possible to leave empty pages in the database.  This did not cause
incorrect behavior, however, it could lead to unexpected growth in the
database.

<p><li>
When doing a partial put into a off-page (that is, "overflow") record,
the Btree access method could incorrectly store the data item.

<p><li>
When an off-page (that is, "overflow") record was promoted to an internal
page of a Btree database, DB applications could dump core when walking
the tree on machines where a certain stack variable was not automatically
initialized to 0.

<p><li>
When an off-page (that is, "overflow") item was promoted into an internal
page in a Btree database, DB applications reading databases on machines
with different byte orders could incorrectly walk the Btree, potentially
dumping core.

<p><li>
When Btree databases had record numbering turned on (the DB_RECNUM
option), it was possible for the record numbers to fail to stay
synchronized with changes in the database.

</ol>

<h3>Recno Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
When iterating through Recno access method databases, DB could incorrectly
return EINVAL instead of the next key/data pair.

<p><li>
Previous releases of DB did not permit Recno access method databases to
be opened read-only.

<p><li>
When reading the last record in a Recno access method database, DB could
incorrectly return DB_NOTFOUND instead of the key/data pair.

<p><li>
When a key/data item was deleted using the cursor interface to a Recno
access method database, a subsequent put using DB_NOOVERWRITE set would
fail.

<p><li>
Because DB version 2 lazily instantiates the underlying shared memory
buffer pool files, the DB-&gt;fd call for Recno databases in the DB 1.85
compatibility interface did not always work.

</ol>

<h3>C++ and Java API Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
When the C++ interface
Db::get()
function was called, DB incorrectly treated the DB_NOTFOUND case as an
exception instead of returning DB_NOTFOUND.

<p><li>
The DB Java interface now sets the CLASSPATH variable instead of depending
on -classpath.  This allows DB to work with the SGI JDK 3.0.1.

<p><li>
Using Dbc.next with the DB_SET or DB_SET_RANGE options in the DB Java
interface would not correctly position the cursor.

<p><li>
The DB Java interface now works correctly with the Solaris JDK 1.2.

</ol>

<h3>Additional Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Shared regions now work correctly for multiple processes on Windows/95
platforms.

<p><li>
It was possible under rare conditions to return illegal addresses when
read-only databases were mapped into the process address space.

<p><li>
When a DB environment had already been specified, setting the
"db_cachesize" field of the DB_INFO structure would be silently
ignored by
db_open(3).
In DB version 2.4.10, specifying a DB environment as well as setting
db_cachesize is considered an error, returning EINVAL.

<p><li>
Several boundary conditions were identified and fixed in database
recovery.

<p><li>
Key-not-found and errno returns were being set incorrectly in the
dbm/ndbm interface compatibility functions.

<p><li>
Under some conditions, database files could still be synced to disk on
close, even if the DB_NOSYNC flag was specified to the DB-&gt;close function.

<p><li>
Under some conditions, the db_archive utility output could contain
multiple slashes in pathnames.

<p><li>
The db_archive utility would always prepend the current working
directory pathname when the -a option was specified, regardless
of the DB environment information indicating that the database
home was at an absolute pathname.

<p><li>
Page create statistics were not correctly maintained when the
DB_MPOOL_NEW option was specified to the shared memory buffer
pool subsystem.

<p><li>
Under rare conditions, log offsets were not maintained correctly when
switching between log files.

</ol>

<h3>Additional Changes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
The transaction ID space in Berkeley DB is 2<sup>31</sup>, or 2 billion
entries.
It is possible that some environments may need to be aware of this limitation.
Consider an application performing 600 transactions a second for 15 hours a
day.
The transaction ID space will run out in roughly 66 days:
<blockquote>
2<sup>31</sup> / (600 * 15 * 60 * 60) = 66
</blockquote>
<p>
Doing only 100 transactions a second exhausts the transaction ID space in
roughly one year.
<p>
In order to decrease the likelihood of exhausting the transaction ID space,
Berkeley DB now resets the transaction ID each time that recovery is run.
See
db_txn(1)
for more information.

<p><li>
The limitations on database lifetime imposed by the Berkeley DB logging
subsystem has been documented.  See
db_log(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
Performance measurements of Berkeley DB indicated that a significant
amount of time was spent in searching hash queues in the shared memory
buffer pools.  The internal DB hash bucket code has been enhanced to
handle much larger core memories than was possible previously, which
should result in increased performance when using large memory pool
caches.

<p><li>
Performance measurements of Berkeley DB indicated that a significant
amount of time was spent in searching lock queues, and, specifically, in
calculating hash values of lock queue elements.  Fast hash functions
specifically for DB's use have been added to the lock subsystem to
alleviate this problem.

<p><li>
Performance measurements of Berkeley DB indicated that a significant
amount of time was spent in determining the number of processors on
the Windows/NT platform.  The value is now determined initially and
then stored.

<p><li>
Historically, the
db_appinit(3)
function returned EINVAL if an application attempted recovery, by
specifying DB_RECOVER or DB_RECOVER_FATAL, and there were no log
files currently in the database environment.  In the 2.4.10 release,
this is no longer an error.

<p><li>
The mutex locking code has been enhanced to no longer attempt full
test-and-set instructions unless there is a strong probability of
acquiring the mutex.  This makes spinning on the mutex significantly
less expensive.

<p><li>
The count of attempted mutex locks (mutex_set_wait) has been changed to
be incremented every time a process/thread is refused the lock, instead
of only once when it first requests the lock and is denied.

<p><li>
The
db_dump185(1)
utility has been enhanced to dump DB version 1.86 databases as well as
DB version 1.85 databases.

<p><li>
The
db_stat(1)
utility has been enhanced to display values larger than 10 million in
a new format, "###M".

<p><li>
The
db_stat(1)
utility has been enhanced to display lock region statistics.
See
db_stat(1)
and
db_lock(3)
for more information.
