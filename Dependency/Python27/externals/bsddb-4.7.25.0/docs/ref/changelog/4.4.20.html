<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 4.4.20 Change Log</h3>

<h3>Changes since Berkeley DB 4.4.16:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Add support for Visual Studio 2005. [#13521]
<li>Fix a bug with in-memory transaction logs when files wrapped around
the buffer. [#13589]
<li>Fix a bug where we needed to close replications open files during
replication initialization. [#13623]
<li>Fix a bug which could leave locks in the environment if database
compaction was run in a transactional environment on a non-transactional
database.  This might have also have triggered deadlocks if the database
was opened transactionally. [#13680]
<li>Fix a bug where setting the DB_REGISTER flag could result in
unnecessarily running recovery, or corruption of the registry file on
Windows systems. [#13789]
<li>Fix a bug in Database.compact that could cause JVM crashes or
NullPointerException.  [#13791]
<li>Fix a bug that would cause a trap if an environment was opened
specifying DB_REGISTER and the environment directory could not be found.
[#13793]
<li>Fix a buffer overflow bug when displaying process and thread IDs in
the Berkeley DB statistics output. [#13796]
<li>Fix a bug where if there is insufficient memory for a database key
in a DBT configured to return a key value into user-specified memory,
the cursor is moved forward to the next entry in the database, which can
cause applications to skip key/data pairs. [#13815]
<li>Fix a bug that could cause the loss of an update to a QUEUE database
in a hot backup. [#13823]
<li>Fix a bug where retrieval from a secondary index could result in a
core dump. [#13843]
<li>Fix a bug that could cause part of the free list to become unlinked
if a btree compaction was rolled back due to a transaction abort.
[#13891]
<li>Fix a bug with in-memory logging that could cause a race condition
to corrupt the logs. [#13919]
