<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 2.6.4 Change Log</h3>

<h3>Interface Additions in Berkeley DB 2.6.4:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Berkeley DB now supports a new mode of operation: Concurrent Access Methods.
This configuration supports multiple-reader, single-writer access without
requiring deadlock detection and transaction protection. The new interface
is specified by using the DB_INIT_CDB flag to the db_appinit() function.
<p>
In addition, the DB-&gt;cursor interface has been modified to take a fourth
argument, a <b>flags</b> argument.  This change will require that all
applications using the DB-&gt;cursor interface be modified and recompiled.
(The necessary modification is trivial, simply add a final argument of
<b>0</b> to the DB-&gt;cursor call.)
<p><font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
In previous Berkeley DB releases, cursors in Recno databases with mutable
record numbers had to be re-positioned each time they were used to delete
a record.  This is no longer the case, and all of the records in the
database logically at and above the cursor may now be deleted by
repeatedly calling the delete function after positioning the cursor once.
This change causes Berkeley DB practice to conform to the documentation
found in previous releases.
<p><font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
Berkeley DB no longer permits applications to specify database page sizes
that are not powers-of-two.  This change fixes a bug which could cause
application failure, as page alignments were not necessarily correct when
files with page sizes other than powers-of-two were mapped into process
memory.

This change is NOT transparent to applications.

</ol>

<h3>B+tree Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Fix a bug which could cause application failure or corrupted data when
database operations would split a Btree page and then subsequently fail
or attempt to physically delete records after being restarted.

<p><li>
Fix a bug which could cause application failure when deleting records
failed due to a deadlock.

<p><li>
Fix a bug which could cause a NULL pointer dereference when the relinking
of duplicate data item pages failed due to deadlock.

<p><li>
Fix a memory leak where an internal cursor could be left open when
databases were opened.

<p><li>
Fix a single-byte memory leak when the standard DB-&gt;del() interface was
used to delete key/data pairs with duplicate data items.

</ol>

<h3>Hash Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Fix a bug which could cause application failure or data corruption when
deleting on-page duplicate items.

<p><li>
Fix a memory leak when closing cursors.

</ol>

<h3>Recno Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Cursors that referenced deleted records were not correctly updated when
the record was overwritten with new data, and would continue to return
that the record was still in a "deleted" state.

<p><li>
Fix a bug where application specified read-modify-write semantics were
ignored.

<p><li>
Remove lock-coupling behavior in tiny databases to avoid perpetual
deadlock.

<p><li>
Fix a bug where root pages were not always correctly write-locked.

</ol>

<h3>Java API Changes and Bug Fixes</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Fix compile include directory ordering, which could cause Java to be
compiled using the wrong db.h include file.

</ol>

<h3>General Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Fix a bug which left the read-modify-write semantics in place after the
operation for which the application specified it completed.

<p><li>
Fix a bug which caused application failure if a NULL key argument was
specified for the DB_AFTER, DB_BEFORE or DB_CURRENT flags to the
DBcursor-&gt;get() interface.

<p><li>
Change the initial mutex timer back-off from 10ms to 1ms.

</ol>

<h3>Shared Memory Buffer Pool Subsystem Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Fix a bug in large database files (&gt;4Gb), which could potentially cause
data corruption when a database was closed, reopened and new pages were
then allocated.

<p><li>
Modify the memp_sync() interface code to no longer hold Berkeley DB region
locks across memory allocation calls (for example, malloc(3)).  This
change significantly increases throughput in applications checkpointing
large memory caches.

<p><li>
Modify the memory pool qsort(3) comparison function to work when called
by badly written qsort(3) functions.

</ol>

<h3>Additional Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Fix a bug in the Berkeley DB error functions where variable numbers of
arguments were not correctly accessed on some architectures, for
example, the PowerPC.

</ol>

<h3>System Porting and Build Procedure Changes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Support installation into prefix directories for which multiple directory
components do not yet exist.

<p><li>
Support installation into different system directories on a per-type
basis, for example, all the binaries to one directory, and include files to
another.

<p><li>
Fix a bug where the supplied portability routine memcpy() was not
correctly compiled.

<p><li>
Modify auto-configuration to refuse to configure in the top-level
distribution directory.

</ol>
