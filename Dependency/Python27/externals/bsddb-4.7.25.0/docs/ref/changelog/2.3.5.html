<h3 align=center>Interface Changes introduced in DB 2.3.5:</h3>

<ol>

<li>
It has come to our attention that there are versions of the native Solaris
compiler that order bit fields inside of structures differently than other
compilers, for example, gcc.
Some of the on-page B+tree structures contained bit fields, which meant that
databases built using these compilers were incompatible with databases built
on other architectures, for example, a Solaris database could not be
read on an x86 architecture which used gcc as its compiler.  The DB
2.3.5 release fixes this problem.
<p>
<font color=red>
Unfortunately, depending on the Solaris compiler used, the change may cause
DB version 2.3.5 on Solaris to be unable to read databases written by earlier
versions of DB.
</font>
If you have a support contract with Sleepycat Software, please contact
us for further information and assistance in migrating databases from
previous releases of DB to this release.
