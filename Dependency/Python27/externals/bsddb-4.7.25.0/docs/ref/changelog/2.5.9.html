<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 2.5.9 Change Log</h3>

<h3>Interface Additions in Berkeley DB 2.5.9:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
A new flag is available in this release for the Berkeley DB cursor
key/data retrieval interface: <b>DB_NEXT_DUP</b>.  This flag causes the
DBcursor-&gt;c_get routine to return the next duplicate in a list of
duplicates, and DB_NOTFOUND if there are no additional duplicates to
return.

<p><li>
A new flag is available in this release for the Berkeley DB cursor
key/data retrieval interfaces: <b>DB_GET_BOTH</b>.  This flag causes the
DB-&gt;get and DBcursor-&gt;c_get routines to return success only if <b>both</b>
the specified key and data items match the entry in the database.

<p><li>
A new flag is available in this release for the Berkeley DB key/data
retrieval interfaces: <b>DB_RMW</b>.  This flag causes the DB-&gt;get and
DBcursor-&gt;c_get routines to acquire write locks instead of read locks when
doing the retrieval.  Setting this flag may decrease the likelihood of
deadlock during a read-modify-write cycle by immediately acquiring the
write lock during the read part of the cycle, so that another thread of
control acquiring a read lock for the same item, in its own
read-modify-write cycle, will not result in deadlock.

<p><li>
A new flag is available in this release: <b>DB_DUPSORT</b>.  This flag
causes duplicate records to be maintained in sorted order.  By default,
the sort order is the same default lexical sort used by the Btree access
method.  A new field, in the DB_INFO structure passed to the db_open
routine, is available in this release as well: <b>dup_compare</b>.  This
field is a sort function that is optionally used to sort duplicate data
items.  It is intended to allow applications to maintain duplicates in a
non-standard sort order.

<p><li>
A new interface is available in this release, <b>DB-&gt;join</b>.  This
interface takes a set of Berkeley DB cursors as arguments, and returns a
specialized Berkeley DB cursor whose get function performs a database join
on the records referenced by the set of cursors.

<p><li>
A new field is available in this release, set in the Berkeley DB structure
returned by db_open, <b>DB-&gt;byteswapped</b>.  This field is set if the
underlying database was not in the native host byte order, and can be used
by the application to determine if its stored data will require host-order
cleanups before use.

<p><li>
The dbmclose() interface has been added to the Berkeley DB dbm/ndbm
compatibility interface, for application compatibility with the Sun
Microsystems Solaris and other dbm/ndbm interfaces.

</ol>

<h3>Interface Changes in Berkeley DB 2.5.9:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Previous Berkeley DB releases have been inconsistent with respect to which
<b>DBT structure</b> flags may be specified to which Berkeley DB
interfaces.  For example, calling DB-&gt;put with the DB_DBT_MALLOC flag
specified makes no sense, and DB has been inconsistent historically as to
whether this was treated as an error or simply ignored.
<p>
As of this release, inappropriate flags in the DBT structure will simply
be ignored.  This is intended to make it easy to, for example, retrieve
a key/data pair and then use the data DBT as the key DBT for another
database without having to reinitialize the flags in the DBT.
<p>
Previous Berkeley DB releases also required that threaded applications
always set the DB_DBT_MALLOC or DB_DBT_USERMEM flags in DBT structures
when retrieving key/data items.  As of this release, specifying
DB_DBT_MALLOC or DB_DBT_USERMEM is only required when using the non-cursor
DB interfaces (for example, DB-&gt;get).  When using cursor interfaces
(for example, DBcursor-&gt;c_get), the flags are not required, as memory
in which the key/data items are returned is allocated and maintained on
a per-cursor basis.

<p><li>
Berkeley DB log files are now named <b>log.XXXXXXXXXX</b> instead of
<b>log.XXXXX</b>, in order to ensure that applications do not run out of
log filename space.
<p><font color=red>
This change is transparent to applications, but may NOT be transparent to
local shell scripts and utilities.
</font>

<p><li>
Previous Berkeley DB releases returned statistics for the Btree databases
that were only valid for the lifetime of the handle with which they were
requested, that is, these statistics as returned for a particular Berkeley
DB handle would only reflect database operations done by that Berkeley DB
handle and any cursors associated with it.
<p>
The following statistics have been removed from the returned Btree
statistical information:  <b>bt_freed</b>, <b>bt_pfxsaved</b>,
<b>bt_split</b>, <b>bt_rootsplit</b>, <b>bt_fastsplit</b>,
<b>bt_added</b>, <b>bt_deleted</b>, <b>bt_get</b>, <b>bt_cache_hit</b>,
<b>bt_cache_miss</b>.  If any of these are sufficiently useful to
application writers that they should be put back into the system, please
let us know.
<p><font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
Previous Berkeley DB releases did not support embedded white space in
Berkeley DB environment configuration strings.  As of this release,
configuration NAME/VALUE strings are still separated by one or more
whitespace characters (which are discarded), but the VALUE string may
contain embedded whitespace characters and is terminated by trailing
whitespace characters and a newline character, both of which are also
discarded.  In addition, empty lines and lines whose first character is
a whitespace or hash (<b>#</b>) character, in the Berkeley DB
configuration, file are discarded.
<p><font color=red>
This change is potentially NOT transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
The DB_REGION_INIT flag to the db_value_set interface has been enhanced
to write a byte to each page in the region.  This allows applications
to use DB_REGION_INIT to ensure that there is sufficient disk space for
the backing region file.

</ol>

<h3>Berkeley DB Environment failures:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
There exists a class of errors that Berkeley DB considers fatal to an
entire Berkeley DB environment.  An example of this type of error is a
log write failure due to the disk being out of free space.  The only way
to recover from these failures is for the application to exit, run
recovery of the Berkeley DB environment, and re-enter DB.  (It is not
strictly necessary that the application exit, although that is the only
way to recover system resources, for example, file descriptors and
memory, currently allocated by Berkeley DB.)
<p>
In previous Berkeley DB releases, the only way an application could
determine that a fatal error had occurred was to monitor Berkeley DB
function return values, looking for unexpected ones, such as ENOSPC, or
EPERM (which has historically been returned by Berkeley DB to indicate a
potential underlying database corruption).
<p>
As of this release, we have added a new error return value, DB_RUNRECOVERY.
 This error can be returned by <b>any</b> Berkeley DB interface.  If a
fatal error occurs, DB_RUNRECOVERY will then be returned from all
subsequent DB calls made by any threads or processes participating in the
DB environment.
<p>
The EPERM error return no longer has a special meaning in Berkeley DB.
<p>
Optionally, applications may also specify a fatal-error callback function
by setting the <b>db_paniccall</b> field of the DB_ENV structure before
initializing the environment with db_appinit (DbEnv::appinit).  This
callback function will be called with two arguments: the DB_ENV structure
associated with the environment and the errno value associated with the
underlying error that caused the problem.
<p>
Applications can handle fatal errors in one of two ways: by checking for
DB_RUNRECOVERY as part of their normal Berkeley DB error return checking,
or, in applications that have no cleanup processing of their own, by
simply exiting the application when the callback function is called.
<p>
We would be very interested in any comments that you'd care to make on
this interface change, in particular, any comments on the sufficiency
of the interface for your Berkeley DB application.
<p><font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>
</blockquote>

<h3>Documentation Changes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
The Berkeley DB documentation has been completely reworked.  It is no
longer available in flat text, UNIX roff or PostScript formats, but is
now <b>only available in HTML format</b>.  To use the Berkeley DB
documentation, point your browser to the Berkeley DB distribution or
installation directory <b>db-2.5.9/docs/index.html</b>.  This release
also includes the beginnings of the Berkeley DB Reference Guide, as well
as the manual pages.

</ol>

<h3>B+tree Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Cursor delete operations were not necessarily being undone after deadlock,
potentially leading to incorrect data.

<p><li>
Deleted, off-page duplicate items could be recovered incorrectly,
potentially leading to incorrect data.

<p><li>
Log records could be written outside of a transaction under some
circumstances, potentially corrupting the log so that recovery would fail.

<p><li>
Completely emptying large trees could cause corruption of the database
root page during the final reverse split.

<p><li>
Failure during page split could leave cursors referencing incorrect data.

<p><li>
Retrieving records based on logical record number could return incorrect
data if logically adjacent records had previously been deleted.

<p><li>
The Btree access method is more aggressive in this release about
discarding locks within transactions that are not needed for correctness.
This change significantly decreases the probability of deadlock for some
applications.

</ol>

<h3>Hash Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Storing duplicate data items using the DB_CURRENT flag could result in
incorrect data.

<p><li>
Cursors and their locks did not always return unchanged on operation
failure.

<p><li>
Entering a sufficient number of duplicate data items into the database
could result in incorrect cursor positioning and/or a corrupted database.

</ol>

<h3>Recno Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
The logical record number returned from DB_APPEND calls was stored into
library memory instead of into the user-specified memory.

<p><li>
The memory in which the backing source filename was stored could be freed
multiple times, potentially leading to application core dump.

</ol>

<h3>General Access Method Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Incorrectly treated setting the database cachesize in the presence of a
Berkeley DB environment to be an error, even if the environment didn't
not initialize a shared memory buffer pool.

<p><li>
Using the DBcursor-&gt;c_get interface with the DB_KEYFIRST or DB_KEYLAST
flags to insert a new key into the database would fail.

<p><li>
In previous Berkeley DB releases each cursor operation (when not part of
a transaction) potentially used a different locker ID, making it possible
for cursor operations to lock against themselves.  In the 2.5.9 release,
the cursor locker ID is maintained for the life of the cursor, instead.

<p><li>
The optional user-specified transaction recovery function was not being
called during Berkeley DB recovery, and when using the db_printlog
utility.

<p><li>
Pages of duplicate data items were incorrectly split and logged/recovered,
potentially leading to database corruption.

<p><li>
During recovery, deleted database files could cause recovery to fail.

</ol>

<h3>C++ API Changes and Bug Fixes</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
A DbEnv::version method has been added to allow access to major, minor
and patch numbers for the current version.

<p><li>
The DbEnv class has been cleaned up so that inappropriate get and set
methods have been removed:
<p>
<blockquote>
DbEnv::get_data_cnt<br>
DbEnv::get_data_dir<br>
DbEnv::get_data_next<br>
DbEnv::get_flags<br>
DbEnv::get_home<br>
DbEnv::get_log_dir<br>
DbEnv::get_tmp_dir<br>
DbEnv::set_data_cnt<br>
DbEnv::set_data_dir<br>
DbEnv::set_data_next<br>
DbEnv::set_flags<br>
DbEnv::set_home<br>
DbEnv::set_log_dir<br>
DbEnv::set_tmp_dir<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
These methods are unneeded because the constructor with arguments,
or the appinit() method, can be used to set this information.
<p>
<blockquote>
DbEnv::get_errcall<br>
DbEnv::get_errfile<br>
DbEnv::get_error_model<br>
DbEnv::get_error_stream<br>
DbEnv::get_errpfx<br>
DbEnv::get_lg_max<br>
DbEnv::get_lk_conflicts<br>
DbEnv::get_lk_detect<br>
DbEnv::get_lk_max<br>
DbEnv::get_lk_modes<br>
DbEnv::get_lorder<br>
DbEnv::get_mp_mmapsize<br>
DbEnv::get_mp_size<br>
DbEnv::get_tx_max<br>
DbEnv::get_tx_recover<br>
DbEnv::get_verbose<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
These get methods accessed information that was never set by Berkeley DB.

<p><li>
Remaining DbEnv::set_* methods may throw an exception if they are called
after the environment has been initialized (either via appinit or the
constructor with arguments).

<p><li>
The DbInfo class has been reworked so that inappropriate get methods
have been removed.  These get methods accessed information that was
never set by Berkeley DB.
<p>
<blockquote>
DbInfo::get_bt_compare<br>
DbInfo::get_bt_maxkey<br>
DbInfo::get_bt_minkey<br>
DbInfo::get_bt_prefix<br>
DbInfo::get_cachesize<br>
DbInfo::get_flags<br>
DbInfo::get_h_ffactor<br>
DbInfo::get_h_hash<br>
DbInfo::get_h_nelem<br>
DbInfo::get_lorder<br>
DbInfo::get_malloc<br>
DbInfo::get_pagesize<br>
DbInfo::get_re_delim<br>
DbInfo::get_re_len<br>
DbInfo::get_re_pad<br>
DbInfo::get_re_source<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Methods to get and set underlying lock identifiers in a DbLock have
been removed, as lock identifiers should be completely opaque to the
application.

</ol>

<h3>Java API Changes and Bug Fixes</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
The DB_SET_RANGE flag did not correctly return data items.

<p><li>
Db.stat() is now declared to return an Object.  The object returned is of
type DbBtreeStat if the file was created using Db.DB_BTREE.  In the
future, this will return other types, for example, DbHashStat.
<p>
The DbBtreeStat, DbLockStat, DbMpoolFStat, DbMpoolStat and DbTxnStat classes
have been changed to allow direct access to their data members.  DbLogStat
is a new class.

<p><li>
The DbEnv class has been reworked and all inappropriate get and set
methods have been removed:
<p>
<blockquote>
DbEnv.get_data_cnt<br>
DbEnv.get_data_next<br>
DbEnv.get_flags<br>
DbEnv.get_home<br>
DbEnv.get_log_dir<br>
DbEnv.get_tmp_dir<br>
DbEnv.set_data_cnt<br>
DbEnv.set_data_next<br>
DbEnv.set_flags<br>
DbEnv.set_home<br>
DbEnv.set_log_dir<br>
DbEnv.set_tmp_dir<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
These methods are unneeded because the constructor with arguments, or the
appinit() method, can be used to set this information.

<p>
<blockquote>
DbEnv.get_errcall<br>
DbEnv.get_errpfx<br>
DbEnv.get_lg_max<br>
DbEnv.get_lk_conflicts<br>
DbEnv.get_lk_detect<br>
DbEnv.get_lk_max<br>
DbEnv.get_lk_modes<br>
DbEnv.get_lorder<br>
DbEnv.get_mp_mmapsize<br>
DbEnv.get_mp_size<br>
DbEnv.get_tx_max<br>
DbEnv.get_verbose<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
These get methods used to access information that was never set by
Berkeley DB.
<p>
The DbEnv.get_java_version_string method has been removed, and the Java
part of Berkeley DB no longer maintains its own version information.

<p><li>
Remaining DbEnv.set_* methods may throw a DbException if they are called
after the environment has been initialized (either via appinit or the
constructor with arguments).

<p><li>
The DbInfo class has been reworked so that inappropriate get methods
have been removed.  These get methods used to access information that
was never set by Berkeley DB.
<p>
<blockquote>
DbInfo.get_bt_maxkey<br>
DbInfo.get_bt_minkey<br>
DbInfo.get_cachesize<br>
DbInfo.get_flags<br>
DbInfo.get_h_ffactor<br>
DbInfo.get_h_hash<br>
DbInfo.get_h_nelem<br>
DbInfo.get_lorder<br>
DbInfo.get_pagesize<br>
DbInfo.get_re_delim<br>
DbInfo.get_re_len<br>
DbInfo.get_re_pad<br>
DbInfo.get_re_source<br>
</blockquote>

<p><li>
Methods to get and set underlying lock identifiers in a DbLock have
been removed, as lock identifiers should be completely opaque to the
application.

<p><li>
The DbRunRecoveryException class has been added as a subclass of
DbException.  A DbRunRecoveryException object will be thrown when a
fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, requiring recovery to be performed.

</ol>

<h3>Shared Memory Buffer Pool Subsystem Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
It was possible for threads opening and closing databases in a fairly full
buffer cache to free memory that was still in use, resulting in
application failure.

<p><li>
If the memp_trickle() interface was unable to find a single buffer to
flush in the entire buffer list, it would return with the shared memory
region mutex locked.

<p><li>
Opening underlying files of certain sizes in the buffer pool would
incorrectly fail.

</ol>

<h3>Locking Subsystem Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
If the a locker being forced to wait does not currently hold any locks,
the deadlock detector is no longer run.

</ol>

<h3>Logging Subsystem Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
If the first log get call after database recovery used the DB_NEXT flag,
it would fail.

<p><li>
If databases were opened multiple times without intervening closes,
recovery could fail.

<p><li>
A memory leak in the log_archive interface has been fixed.

</ol>

<h3>Additional Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
Windows/NT: using shared anonymous memory did not work correctly between
processes sharing the database.

<p><li>
Utilities: Signal handling and Berkeley DB region exit was incorrect.
Among other issues, the db_load utility could exit holding a region mutex.

<p><li>
Dbm/Ndbm: System error values were not always being correctly returned.

</ol>

<h3>System Porting and Build Procedure Changes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
A alpha-release port to VMS has been added to the Berkeley DB
distribution.  The port has not yet run the Berkeley DB test
suite, but there are no known problems.

<p><li>
Berkeley DB now uses the pstat_getdynamic(2) interface on Hewlett-Packard
HP/UX systems to detect the presence of multiple processors.

<p><li>
For performance reasons, the Berkeley DB release now uses the Sun
Microsystems Solaris pread(2) and pwrite(2) UNIX interfaces, if they
are available.

<p><li>
Berkeley DB now compiles with the -D_THREAD_SAFE C preprocessor flag
and loads with the libc_r.a C library by default on FreeBSD systems.

<p><li>
For portability reasons, shared memory segments allocated using the UNIX
shmget(2) function are now allocated as IPC_PRIVATE. (Apparently, marking
them as IPC_PRIVATE does not affect that they are available to other
processes.)

<p><li>
The standard UNIX install for the Berkeley DB library now installs
Berkeley DB into its own hierarchy instead of into separate local
directories.  By default, the install locations are:
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr> 
        <th>Location</th>
        <th>Contents</th>
</tr><tr>
        <td>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/bin</td>
        <td>binaries</td>
</tr><tr>
        <td>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/include</td>
        <td>include files</td>
</tr><tr>
        <td>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib</td>
        <td>libraries</td>
</tr><tr>
        <td>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/docs</td>
        <td>HTML documentation</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><li>
For portability reasons, the standard UNIX Berkeley DB library archive is
built with the <b>-cr</b> options in this release, instead of the
<b>-cq</b> options as done previously.

<p><li>
The standard UNIX Berkeley DB configuration will now automatically detect
and use gcc if no compiler named cc is found.

<p><li>
When the C pre-processor DIAGNOSTIC value is #defined, memory is
overwritten with a 0xdb pattern instead of a 0xff pattern.

</ol>

<h3>Additional Changes: db_dump</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
The db_dump utility has a new option, <b>-N</b>.  This option allows
db_dump to be run without acquiring any shared region mutexes.  This
option is intended for debugging use only.

<p><li>
The db_dump utility now allows a Berkeley DB environment directory to be
specified (the <b>-h</b> option) at the same time as the "debugging
output" option (the <b>-d</b> option).

<p><li>
The db_dump utility now uses the shared memory buffer pool region if a
Berkeley DB environment directory is specified, which allows users to see
the current state of the database instead of only the database state that
has already been flushed to disk.

</ol>
